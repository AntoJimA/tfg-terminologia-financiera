Efficient support of short food supply chains in Hungary: A spatial analysis — There is an increasing political interest in Hungary to relocalize food. A Policy Intervention for Food Relocalization Index is introduced to quantitatively reveal how rural development programme measures should be allocated efficiently to promote local food production. Results show that present level of food activity and future prospects mismatch. Eastern Hungary has the highest potential for further development as it has relatively high level of food activity and food production capacity. The few small-scale farmers operating in Budapest area have been already engaged in short food supply chains to enjoy the various benefits (and higher profit).
