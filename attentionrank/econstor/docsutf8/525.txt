Romania case — There are three features as well as concepts of the development reforms which can be identified in the European Strategy 2020, namely: the intelligent development, the sustainable development and the inclusion aiding development. The hypothesis which supports the new development policy of the EU is based on the idea that a lasting and favourable for inclusion growth is crucial in order to diminish the long term poverty. This is why the development policies aim to stimulate the human capacity so that this could head to prosperity, wealth and the creation of new work places.

Starting from this aspect obviously some questions can arise: "To what extent has Romania put into practice this objective of the European Union?" or "which is the satisfaction level of the population working in the agricultural field?"
