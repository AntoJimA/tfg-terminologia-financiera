Ruin analysis of a discrete-time dependent Sparre Andersen model with external financial activities and randomized dividends — We consider a discrete-time dependent Sparre Andersen risk model which incorporates multiple threshold levels characterizing an insurer's minimal capital requirement, dividend paying situations, and external financial activities. We focus on the development of a recursive computational procedure to calculate the finite-time ruin probabilities and expected total discounted dividends paid prior to ruin associated with this model. We investigate several numerical examples and make some observations concerning the impact our threshold levels have on the finite-time ruin probabilities and expected total discounted dividends paid prior to ruin.
