Public health risk control in international sports events: Strategy evolution in the post-pandemic period — The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need to revise traditional security strategies for international sporting events and has brought public health issues to the forefront as a systemic component. The study aimed to address the transformation of security management strategies at mass sporting events in the post-pandemic reality. The research methodology was based on the use of such scientific methods as structural and functional analysis, methods of analogy and analytical review, which ensured a comprehensive and integrated coverage of the issue. The study determined that sanitary and epidemiological control has ceased to be a secondary function and has become a structural axis of strategic planning. The examples of the Olympic and Paralympic Games in Tokyo in 2021 and the FIFA World Cup in Qatar in 2022 demonstrated that a high level of efficiency was achieved both under severe restrictions and moderate scenarios, providing digital support and vaccination coverage. In addition, the study determined that digital platforms in the COVID and post-COVID period became central for control and analytics, forecasting and modelling risk behaviour. At the same time, barriers have been identified in the form of inequality of access, politicisation of health and fragmentation of the regulatory framework. As a conclusion, the study proposed to use the concept of integrated risk management, which involved cross-sectoral coordination, adaptive scenario planning and digital support for early warning systems. The significance of the study is determined by the outline of a systematic framework for rethinking security strategies at mass sporting events, which can be used as an analytical basis for the development of practical recommendations.
