How bad it is to be good: Impact of organizational ethical culture on whistleblowing (the ethical partners) — Whistleblowers are ostracized and isolated for identifying wrongdoings. Despite this deterrent, the whistleblowers have not recoiled. Nonetheless, organizations need to develop an ethical corporate culture, where employees become "ethical partners" and do the right thing, not because they have to, but because they want to. The study aimed to measure the effects of ethical cultural practices using the lens of Kaptein's (2008) Corporate Ethical Virtues Model (CEVM). Split Questionnaire Survey Design (SDSD) was chosen to record responses of 104 internal auditors working in nine public and sixteen private sector organizations. Results reveal significant positive relationships between whistleblowing and the CEVM virtues.
