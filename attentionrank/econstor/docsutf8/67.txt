Fast Efficient Importance Sampling by State Space Methods — We show that efficient importance sampling for nonlinear non-Gaussian state space models can be implemented by computationally efficient Kalman filter and smoothing methods. The result provides some new insights but it primarily leads to a simple and fast method for efficient importance sampling. A simulation study and empirical illustration provide some evidence of the computational gains.
