Is social capital part of the institutions continuum? — Social capital is generally interpreted as the degree  of trust, co-operative norms and networks  and associations within a society. Economists have become increasingly interested in social capital, following the seminal work of Coleman (1988) and Putnam (1993). Since the publication of these studies a vast quantity of research on social capital has been published by  economists, as well as researchers from other academic disciplines. This paper argues that in  terms of its definition, and the arguments advanced as to why social capital is likely to affect  economic performance, social capital is a very similar concept to what North (1990) defined as  informal institutions. This suggests that social capital can be empirically modelled as a deep  determinant of economic development.
