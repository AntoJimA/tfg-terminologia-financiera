Dynamic Wage Bargaining if Benefits are Tied to Individual Wages — In dynamic wage bargaining models it is usually assumed that individual unemployment
benefits are a fraction of the average wage level. In most countries, however, unemployment
benefits are instead tied to the previous level of individually earned wages. We show how the
analysis has to be modified if this fact is taken into account and compare our findings for the
wage-setting curve with outcomes under other unemployment compensation schemes. In
particular, we show that the widely used vertical wage-setting curve relies on more restrictive
assumptions than usually considered. We also demonstrate that a reduction of unemployment
benefits of those who get unemployed after the bargaining period leads to higher
equilibrium unemployment.
