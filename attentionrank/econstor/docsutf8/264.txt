The role of female population, urbanization and trade openness in sustainable environment: The case of carbon dioxide emissions in Ghana — Sustainable environment offers many benefits to individuals and societies. As a result, the agenda to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in order to mitigate climate change remains a global concern. Researchers, policymakers and governments have shown interest in this regard. Empirical studies on the subject matter have been increasing conflicting results and little evidence on the effects of some variables necessitate for further studies. To offer value to the literature, in this study, the effect of female population, urbanization and trade openness on carbon dioxide emission in Ghana is assessed. The study used the Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence, & Technology (STIRPAT) model as the foundation for empirical modelling. Time-series data spanning from 1971-2021 were used for regression analysis. In both long run and short run periods, urbanization was noted to exert positive influence on carbon dioxide emission while trade openness and female population exert a negative effect on carbon dioxide emission. Thus, growth in urbanization increases carbon dioxide emission while the opposite effect is the case for trade openness and the female population. Findings from the study suggest the need to intensify the empowerment of women, which could be a crucial catalyst for the achievement of Ghana's nationally determined contributions toward CO2 reduction. Also, international trade negotiations that promote environmental protection should not be relaxed.
