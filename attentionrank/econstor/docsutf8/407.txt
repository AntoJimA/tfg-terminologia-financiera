Familiarity with mission and vision: Impact on organizational commitment and job satisfaction — Background: The relationship between organizational mission and vision statements, organizational commitment, and job satisfaction has been discussed vastly in previous research, both in the domain of public sector organizations and in profit organizations. Objectives: The goal is to investigate if there are differences in organizational commitment and job satisfaction between employees who are familiar with the mission and vision of their organization, compared to those who are not familiar with them. Methods/Approach: A survey research has been conducted on a sample of 114 employees in private and public sector organizations in the Republic of Croatia. Data were analysed using a t-test to determine the differences between two groups of respondents, i.e. those who are familiar with the visions and mission of their organisation, and those who are not. Results: There are differences in job satisfaction levels between employees who are familiar with the mission and vision of the organization in which they are employed and those who are not. Furthermore, differences are particularly evident in the group of public sector employees. Conclusions: The presence of awareness of the organizational mission and vision among employees has a positive effect on their job satisfaction. This is possibly an indicator of the organization's culture, which fosters positive values embedded in the organizational vision and mission.
