Relationship of benevolent leadership and organizational citizenship behavior: Interactional effect of perceived organizational support and perceived organizational politics — Benevolent leadership has emerged as a contemporary leadership style that has scantly been studied. To address this gap in literature, current research pursues a threefold objective. First, it validates the measurement scale of benevolent leadership in the context of Pakistan. Second, it tests the effect of benevolent leadership on employees' organizational citizenship behavior (OCB). Third, it studies the role of perceived organizational support (POS) and perceived organizational politics (POP) as potential moderators. Data was collected from a representative sample of 202 information technology companies operating in Pakistan through structured questionnaires. Confirmatory factor analysis via AMOS was conducted to validate the measurement scale. Model fit indices, AVE and Fornell & Larcker criteria provided the evidence of its validity, while reliability was ensured through Cronbach's alpha and composite reliability measures. The analysis through linear regression and PROCESS MACRO revealed that benevolent leadership enhances employees' OCB. Furthermore, POP and POS moderate the relationship between benevolent leadership and employees' OCB.
