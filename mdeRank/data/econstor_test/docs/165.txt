Public-private partnership and schooling outcomes across countries — The paper provides a comparative analysis of the association between student achievement
and public-private partnerships (PPPs) in schooling across countries. Student-level data from
the PISA international achievement test provides information on the public-private character
of both operation and funding of each tested school. Across countries, public operation is
associated with lower student outcomes, but public funding with better student outcomes.
Thus, systems of PPPs that combine private operation with public funding do best among all
possible operation-funding combinations, while PPPs that combine public operation with
private funding do worst. The advantage of private operation is particularly strong in
countries with large shares of public funding.
