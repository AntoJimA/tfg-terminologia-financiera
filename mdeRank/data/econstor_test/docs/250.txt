A new approach to strategic objectives ranking based on fuzzy logarithmic least squares method and fuzzy similarity technique — In this paper, we discuss the ratings of strategic objectives in a strategy map. In order to have a more useful strategy map and also improve efficiency in the stage of strategy implementation, the significance level of the strategic objective in a strategic map must be determined. In the current study, objectives have been ranked based on strategic destinations, employing a combination of the fuzzy logarithmic least squares method and fuzzy similarity techniques. First, the former is used to obtain the weight of strategic destinations, and then the objectives are ranked through the latter. For this purpose, a company is selected to implement the proposed model with the collaboration of its senior management. The results of the case study indicate that the most important strategic objectives of this company fall under the aspect of learning and growth, helping the company the most to achieve its strategic destinations in this regard.
