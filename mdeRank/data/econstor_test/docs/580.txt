KfW/ZEW CO2 Barometer 2015 – Manufacturing Industry Edition: Impacts of the energy transition — Developed as part of a cooperative project of KfW Bankengruppe and the Centre for European Economic Research (ZEW), the KfW/ZEW CO2 Barometer has been analysing the situation of German companies regulated under the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) on an annual basis since 2009.

The survey questions in the present version address energy price expectations, investment in energy efficiency and the companies’ opinion on the German energy transition...
