Division of Labor and the Organization of Knowledge in Production: A Laboratory Experiment — Following Garicano (2000), we consider groups whose members decide what knowledge to acquire and how to use this knowledge in production. If eﬃcient production requires common knowledge, all group members should become workers and acquire common knowledge. But if eﬃcient production requires diverse knowledge, one group member should become manager, acquire rare knowledge, and stand ready to help the other workers. In our laboratory experiment, we ﬁnd that most groups eventually manage to coordinate on an eﬃcient division of labor. Still, we ﬁnd substantial adoption frictions. Coordination takes time, and some groups coordinate on an ineﬃcient division of labor, probably because they do not understand what organization of knowledge is most eﬃcient.
