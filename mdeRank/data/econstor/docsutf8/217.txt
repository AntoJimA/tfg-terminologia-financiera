Does international trade catch up with national trade of countries? Yes. — The paper applies an index suggested by Jeffrey Frankel on how to measure the gap between the intensity of national versus international transactions of a country to more than 100 countries over four periods between 1990 and 2005. The gap stands for incomplete globalization. It is shown that the gap has steadily declined for most countries over the sample period irrespective of income levels. While larger economies are still less globalized than small economies, differences in domestic market size have become less important as a dividing linie between more and less globalized economies.
