Behavioral study of piston manufacturing plant through stochastic models — Piston plays a vital role in almost all types of vehicles. The present study discusses the behavioral study of a piston manufacturing plant. Manufacturing plants are complex repairable systems and therefore, it is difficult to evaluate the performance of a piston manufacturing plant using stochastic models. The stochastic model is an efficient performance evaluator for repairable systems. In this paper, two stochastic models and computation algorithm of the piston manufacturing plant are illustrated using the state-space transition diagram and availability parameter is used for its behavioral study. Finally, the conclusion is discussed based on the resulting computations.
