Exploring the drivers behind automotive exports in OECD countries: An empirical analysis — The conceptual part of this paper ties the recently developed Lead Market concept to the international trade theory literature including neoclassical trade theory, new trade theory, neotechnological approaches and systems of innovation concepts. The empirical part explores the factors driving exports in the automotive sector in eight OECD countries between 1991 and 2008, explicitly accounting for possible Lead Market factors. Econometric results suggest that exports in the automotive sector are positively related to the general strength of a country in terms of exports, to higher GDP per capita and to a lower labour cost share in the automotive sector. However, domestic market size and R&D in the automotive sector do not exhibit statistically significant effects on exports.
