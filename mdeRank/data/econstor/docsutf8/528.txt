Hot waters, cold realities: Assessing the labor market impacts of marine heatwaves on coastal India — I employ geo-coded household-level data over 2015-2016 combined with a gridded dataset to quantify the impact of marine heatwaves on labor market outcomes in coastal India. I construct an average measure of exposure to marine heatwaves for each household and find that one additional degree heating week increases the probability of being unemployed by 1.9-2.3 percentage points. The effect is larger for households experiencing higher levels of marine heat stress, with an increased probability to be unemployed of 5.5-6.5 percentage points. Other findings highlight a decreased probability to work in the fisheries sector, an increased labor market participation of women as well as a lower chance of having a full year employment after a marine heatwave. These findings highlight the potential socio-economic challenges that climate change may pose to coastal households in the coming decades.
