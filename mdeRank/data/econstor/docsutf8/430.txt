Housing, Mobility and Unemployment — This paper develops a model that shows why high-skilled workers move more and are therefore
unemployed less than low-skilled workers. The model can explain the paradoxical empirical
regularity that higher owner-occupation rates are associated with higher levels of unemployment
although home-owners tend to be unemployed less. The choice of housing tenure affects
moving costs and thereby regional mobility and unemployment. The paper analyzes the impact
of symmetric and asymmetric shocks on mobility and unemployment, and discusses effects of
government intervention in the housing market. In addition, it is shown that moving costs reduce
job search effort and search effectiveness.
