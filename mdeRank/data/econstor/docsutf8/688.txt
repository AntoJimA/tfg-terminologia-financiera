Does financial integration impact performance of equity anomalies? — We examine prominent market anomalies and evaluate the efficacy of alternative asset pricing models under different financial integration settings. A financial integration index is developed for classifying 25 sample markets into high-, medium- and low integration groups. Size is found to be the strongest anomaly in world markets, followed by value and liquidity. Value and profitability effects are larger for low-integrated markets. Highly integrated markets experience short-term momentum while many low-integrated markets exhibit mild reversals. Fama and French five-factor model outperforms capita l asset pricing model (CAPM) and Fama and French three-factor model in explaining returns. International factors augment the role of local factors for more integrated markets. Our study has implications for global investors to design anomaly based investment strategies.
