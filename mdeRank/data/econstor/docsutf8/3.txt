Institutional givism: what is the major determinant of Arabs’ satisfaction in academia? — This study investigates how culture influences job satisfaction among academics. Through a two-stage interview process involving 294 Arab academics, 20 satisfaction categories were identified, with ‘institutional givingness’ emerging as the most significant. Institutional givingness, rooted in Arab culture, reflects the key to satisfaction. It manifests in three forms: tangible, emotional, and cognitive. Three perspectives on satisfaction were highlighted: the role of givingness in organizational dynamics, technology’s influence on satisfaction, and emotional obstacles to givingness. These insights underscore the interaction of cultural, technological, and hierarchical elements in Arab academia. The study contributes in three ways: advocating a ‘power and give’ approach for boosting job satisfaction in Arab contexts; revealing cultural differences in satisfaction determinants, with Arabs placing significant emphasis on givingness; and underscoring the importance of addressing hierarchical, technological, and emotional aspects of givingness. These findings are crucial for policymakers and educational leaders, offering a strategic framework to create a more satisfying academic environment aligned with Arab cultural values and expectations, thereby fostering a more engaged and committed academic workforce.
