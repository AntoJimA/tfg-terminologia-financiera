Strategic wage setting and coordination frictions with multiple applications — We examine wage competition in a model where identical workers choose the number of jobs
to apply for and identical firms simultaneously post a wage. The Nash equilibrium of this
game exhibits the following properties: (i) an equilibrium where workers apply for just one
job exhibits unemployment and absence of wage dispersion; (ii) an equilibrium where
workers apply for two or for more (but not for all) jobs always exhibits wage dispersion and,
typically, unemployment; (iii) the equilibrium wage distribution with a higher vacancy-tounemployment
ratio first-order stochastically dominates the wage distribution with a lower
level of labor market tightness; (iv) the average wage is non-monotonic in the number of
applications; (v) the equilibrium number of applications is non-monotonic in the vacancy-tounemployment
ratio; (vi) a minimum wage increase can be welfare improving because it
compresses the wage distribution and reduces the congestion effects caused by the socially
excessive number of applications; and (vii) the only way to obtain efficiency is to impose a
mandatory wage that eliminates wage dispersion altogether.
