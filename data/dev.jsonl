The register-based data contain information on the municipality of residence of all individuals aged 16 and over that have their main residency in Austria, as well as their income and socio-demographic characteristics. Aggregating this information to the municipality level allows us to assess the role of relative deprivation – a measure of relative income – on top of absolute income in shaping internal migration in Austria. We find that increases in relative deprivation in a municipality lead to higher emigration from the municipality. Allowing for heterogeneous effects across income, education, and age groups reveals that the effect is stronger among those with comparably low levels of income, and among low-skilled and young individuals.", "keywords": ["inequality", "internal migration", "relative deprivation"]}

Climate financing is one of the key mechanisms used to enable countries to remain resilient to the hastening effects of climate change. In this paper, we empirically assess the effect of institutional governance indicators on the amount of climate finance received by 21 nations for which progress towards the internationally agreed-upon target of reducing global warming to 1.5 °C is tracked. We use the fixed-effects ordinary least squares (OLS) and the feasible generalized least squares (FGLS) estimators, drawing on the Climate Action Tracker panel data from 2002 to 2020. Empirical results reveal that perceived political stability significantly enhanced climate finance inflows among countries that strongly increased their NDC targets, while perceived deterioration in corruption control negatively impacted the amount of climate finance received by the same group of countries. Therefore, governments should reduce corruption tendencies while striving to avoid practices and alliances that lead to any form of violence, including terrorism and civil war. Low developing countries (LDCs) in particular need to improve the standard of public services provided to the populace while maintaining a respectable level of autonomy from political influences. Above all, as countries work towards strengthening institutional governance, there is an urgent need for developed economies to assist developing economies in overcoming debt stress since the likelihood of future resilience and prosperity is being undermined by the debt crisis, with developing countries spending almost five times as much annually on repayment of debt as they allocate to climate adaptation", "keywords": ["Climate Action Tracker", "climate finance", "corruption", "panel data"]}

We attribute these mixed estimation results to a raft of empirical issues from which many existing studies suffer, including bias, inconsistency, endogeneity and a failure to adequately account for the combination of persistent and stationary variables. We propose a new method of combining I(0) and I(1) series in a system setting based on the long-run structural approach of Garratt, Lee, Pesaran and Shin (2006). The application of this method to a long sample of US data provides modest support for the operation of a Taylor-type rule, albeit with considerable inertia. We argue that estimation across rolling windows may better reflect shifts in the underlying preferences of the monetary policymakers at the Federal Reserve. Such rolling estimation provides substantial evidence that the inflation and output preferences of the Fed have varied through time, presumably reflecting the prevailing economic and political conditions, its chairmanship, and the composition of the Federal Open Market Committee.

In the climate policy arena, international transfers are frequently seen as an effective means to raise the provision of the global public good 'climate change mitigation'. This paper focuses on a specific type of international transfer that aims at raising mitigation while also reducing the damages from climate change: conditional adaptation support. Especially since the COP in Copenhagen 2009, preparations are on-going to significantly expand international transfers that help developing countries to adapt to climate change. While there are extensive discussions in the policy arena about the required amount of adaptation funding and the best ways to raise, manage and disburse these funds, hardly any attention is paid to the international allocative effects of these transfers. The answer to the question of 'why' international adaptation transfers are paid at all, is often relegated to fairness considerations only. As adaptation benefits are largely local and adaptation transfers reduce the recipients' incentives to contribute to climate change mitigation, one would, however, expect at least unease in donor countries about plans to significantly expand international adaptation support. In this study, we compare two alternative conditional transfer schemes: one plainly subsidizes mitigation efforts, while the other provides adaptation support which is conditional on other agents' mitigation contributions. Disregarding distributional and fairness aspects the paper evaluates and compares the allocative effects of either policy scheme. It is shown that while both policy schemes can be beneficial for developing as well as industrialized countries, this outcome relies strongly on the productivity of mitigation and adaptation technologies.", "keywords": ["adaptation", "conditional transfers", "mitigation"]}

To fill this gap, I study country-level fertility trends before and after 23 pension reforms using a long-run panel dataset starting in 1870.

Contrasting pre- and post-reform trends of the raw fertility rate as well as the fertility regression residual across countries, I do not find robust evidence that pension reforms, on average, affect fertility in the way most theoretical models predict.

We show that gas-specific pricing is primarily related to fall/winter peak-load gas pricing and that mean reversion in relative prices is dependent on the time of the year. Most of the reversion back to oil occurs in spring and summer when demand for gas to heating and electricity is low and net-availability and transport capacity high. Accounting for periods of gas specific pricing is relevant when determining the long-run equilibrium value of oil relative to natural gas. Utilizing the regime where evidence is strongest for integrated markets we find that oil is historically priced at 2.3 times the value of natural gas in the UK, and that markets have been decoupled for 49% of the sample.

The accident-insurance system achieved only one of its intended goals: it successfully compensated workers and their survivors for losses due to accidents. The accident-insurance system was less successful in limiting the growth of work-related accidents, although that goal had been a reason for the system's creation. We trace the failure to stem the growth of accidents to faulty incentives built into the 1884 legislation. The law created mutual insurance groups that used an experience-rating system that stressed group rather than firm experience, leaving firms with little hope of saving on insurance contributions by improving the safety of their own plants. The government regulator increasingly stressed the imposition of safety rules that would force all firms to adopt certain safety practices.

Evidence accumulated since 2003 suggests that nominal rigidities remain a prevalent feature of the euro area, with some differences as regards prices and wages. Price setting may have become more flexible and there is no evidence for any especially strong downward rigidities in price setting. At the same time, persistent downward nominal wage rigidity (DWR) provides a strong argument for a positive inflation buffer to 'grease the wheels' of the euro area economy - also in order to avoid the risk of macroeconomic adjustments being managed in terms of quantities (unemployment) rather than prices when DWR is binding and particularly when productivity growth is low. Inflation differentials across euro area countries have tended to be small but persistent. For inflation dispersion in the euro area, the across countries has been more important than across regions, confirming that an inflation buffer might be especially important in a monetary union of different countries. Overall, inflation differentials were due to the rise of economic and financial imbalances in the first decade of the euro and the subsequent need for adjustment. Balassa-Samuelson effects which were highlighted in the 2003 strategy review were only a minor factor. By and large, the ECB's inflation objective seems to have provided a sufficient margin to prevent countries from having to live with prolonged periods of excessively low inflation rates in the period 1999-2019.

These information disclosures have virtually no effect despite most buyers claiming to value such information. Instead, our data reveal that whether the subject is generally trusting plays an important role. Trust is clearly associated with greater willingness to pay for insurance. Unlike in previous work, trust in our setting is not about obligations being fulfilled. The contract is complete, simple and the possibility of breach is negligible. However, as for much B2C insurance marketing, face-to-face selling plays a crucial role in our experimental design. Trusting buyers are more suggestible, so take advice more readily and buy more insurance, although they are no more risk averse than the uninsured. Moreover, trusting buyers feel less pressured by sellers, and are more confident in their decisions which suggests that they are easier to persuade. Therefore, in markets where persuasion is important, public policy designed to increase consumer information is likely to be ineffective.", "keywords": ["persuasion", "trust"]}

The main economic imaginary ascribes to competition the function of a primary mode for economic and social coordination, ensuring prosperity and wealth. Competitiveness is predominately interpreted not as a means but an end in itself. Furthermore, three partly conflicting discursive positions on how competition should be organized arise in the discourse: first, the neoliberal position interprets every non-efficient market outcome as the result of institutional intervention, hindering effective competition; second, the ordoliberal position of fair competition evaluates governance intervention positively, as long as they promote the functioning of competition; third, the Keynesian position promotes corrected competition, i.e. diverse policy intervention to compensate for market failure outcomes.", "keywords": ["competition", "competitiveness"]}

Empirical evidence from rural China — Poverty alleviation is still one of the major challenges in developing countries, especially in transitional economy like China. From the perspective of anti-poverty, this paper examines the impact of formal credit constraints (FCCs) and informal credit constraints (IFCCs) on economic vulnerability (EV) using the data from the China Household Income Project (CHIP) survey for 2013 (CHIPs 2013) of rural households. The potential endogeneity problem of credit constraints (CCs) is addressed by applying the control function approach within an ordered probit model. The results show that both FCCs and IFCCs have a robust positive and significant impact on the EV of rural households and that the impact of FCCs is greater than that of IFCCs. To identify the potential mechanisms through which CCs affect EV, the seemingly unrelated regressions are used and the potential intercorrelation among these mechanisms is examined. We find that the impact of CCs on EV is partly mediated by health, trust, per capita financial assets and per capita income, whereby health and per capita income contribute to most of the total indirect effect. Thus, policies focus on supply-side and demand-side to improve credit accessibility could reduce rural households' EV, especially through its positive effect on health and per capita income.", "keywords": ["credit constraints", "economic vulnerability", "rural China"]}

This study argues that pensions should be considered deferred pay; as such any discussion on the relative generosity of pension entitlements in the public and private sectors ought to be conducted against the backdrop of relative public and private sector pay levels. The available evidence shows that median pay is higher in the public sector than in the private sector, but using this to assess relative pay levels is misleading. This is because median pay hides significant variations in relative pay across the genders, occupations and by location. For example, the range of occupations available in the private sector is wider at the lower end of the skills distribution range than in the public sector; for female workers the highest median annual pay in 2008 could be found in education, which is overwhelmingly in the public sector. There is evidence that public sector pay is relatively generous for employees at the lower end of the income distribution but this does not hold for employees at the upper end of the income distribution. In addition, there is substantial evidence that public sector pay is relatively less generous in the south east of England generally and in London in particular. Compared with the private sector, the public sector compensates its employees too little for living in low amenity and/or high cost areas. As a consequence, the quality of public services varies across the UK, with the public sector especially in the south east finding it difficult to recruit and retain skilled staff. Anyone contemplating a reform of public sector pensions ought to take into account the knock-on effects on recruitment and retention of highly-skilled staff in all parts of the UK, and in the south east in particular.

As with many other financial products that have emerged in recent years, internet-based investors may be inexperienced in marketplace lending, highlighting the importance of forecasting default rates and evaluating default features such as the loan amount, interest rates, and FICO score. Potential borrowers on marketplace lending platforms may already have been rejected by banks as too risky to lend to, which amplifies the problem of asymmetric information. This paper proposes a holistic data processing flow for the loan status classification of marketplace lending multivariate time series data by using the Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory model (BiLSTM) to predict \"non-default,\" \"distressed,\" and \"default\" loan status, which outperforms conventional techniques. We adopt the SHapely Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and a four-step ahead model, allowing us to extract the most significant features for default risk assessment. Using our approach, lenders and regulators can identify the most relevant features to enhance the default risk assessment method over time in addition to early risk prediction.", "keywords": ["feature importance", "marketplace lending", "SHAP"]}

In this study, we investigate 51 Norwegian master's student teams as they work on an innovation project using DT. We seek especially to understand how they communicate and collaborate while working with DT tools, with special attention to divergent and convergent thinking. Using a mixed methods approach, we analyze the teams' behaviors and developments in these. Findings suggest that the highest performing groups use the DT method with greater discipline than the other groups. To achieve this, they employ more authority-based behaviors and fewer supportive behaviors than the other groups. This disciplined approach to DT as a process and the use of tools, such as brainstorming, are in turn associated with convergent and divergent thinking. The main conclusions are that a disciplined approach using DT as a team tool, enables team reflexivity and psychological safety.

Implications for Stability — The design of wholesale electricity markets in the transition towards liberalization presents significant differences from country to country. Some spot markets have imposed the concentration of transactions to ensure market liquidity. Other markets are based on bilateral trading. The debate about the optimal trading mechanism mainly concentrates on how to deal with the trade off between the liquidity of the market and the stability of the system. The solution chosen by some market is a mandatory pool with a regulated market for electricity derivatives, that allows to hedge price volatility and to mitigate market power. This paper investigates whether, in the presence of a futures market, spot and bilateral trading can operate together and what are possible outcomes in terms of liquidity of the spot market and stability of the system. The paper extends existing literature on the role of futures market on the behavior of spot market prices, developing a multi-period model in which electricity consumers can choose whether to trade on the spot market or negotiate bilateral contracts. Results suggest that a spot market with futures contracts and a market for bilateral contracts are not necessarily alternative ways to manage stability problems, but may co-exist with positive and synergic outcomes on price behaviors and market power.", "keywords": ["Derivatives", "Electricity", "Market power"]}

In all recent trade agreements with partner countries, the EU includes a chapter on Trade and Sustainable Development (TSD) containing provisions to protect and promote international labour and environmental standards. The labour provisions require compliance with the 1998 ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and other frameworks. There are procedural commitments in the chapter that allow for a monitoring of the sustainability impacts of the free trade agreements (FTA). Its institutional mechanisms include the formatin of Domestic Advisory Groups (DAGs) on both sides, and a Joint Civil Society Forum (CSF) for an annual exchange and dialogue between the two DAGs and other civil society representatives on the sustainable development aspects of trade relations between the Parties. The purpose of this mechanism is to politically and publicly support the FTA, monitor the TSD Chapter implementation, provide a forum for democratic dialogue and develop recommendations on how to implement the commitments. However, based on current research on this topic, feedback from civil society stakeholders and own experiences in South Korea and Vietnam, we come to the conclusion that the \"value based trade policies\" by means of TSD Chapters have not yet produced significant results both in terms of improving labour standards and/or enabling civil society to participate in the monitoring of the agreement. The European Commission has acknowledged these deficiencies in 2018 and pledged to work for clear, transparent rules and procedures for the establishment and functoning of representative and balanced civil society structures on the side of the trade partners. But this may not solve the structural and political difficulties when two partners do not share the same political values but formulate human rights and labour standards as part of their trade agreement. A more stringent role for the EU not only before ratification, but also in the implementation phase is necessary, and the European Parliament should play a proactive role here. Overall, the authors are of the opinion, that in a political environment where trading partners have authoritarian political systems and do not share the same political values with the EU, only ex-ante conditionality could safeguard civil society participation and labour rights compliance in trade agreements.

We find that by implementing a floor system, the Eurosystem has eliminated the opportunity costs of holding reserves and enabled banks to hold relatively large buffers of reserves compared with the corridor system. Additionally, the demand for reserves may have increased endogenously, as the environment of ample liquidity conditions has incentivised many banks to adapt their business models. In parallel, the demand for reserves has also increased for more exogenous reasons such as post-global financial crisis liquidity regulation and increased liquidity concentration.

We consider the basic income not only as a tool of a policy to improve living standards and social well-being but, mostly, as the essential requisite to introduce a new stable compromise between capital and labour. Following the French Regulation School approach, we assert that the social compromise between capital and labour is founded on the redistribution of the productivity gains. Therefore we try to trace living standards and social well being problems back to their origins, i.e. the productivity growth. We think that describing the dynamics of productivity means understanding the main features of the contemporary capitalistic production. We first present a survey about BI in economic literature. We then focus on the socio-economic transformation of western countries and propose the term cognitive capitalism (CC) to describe the economic system after the Fordism paradigm crisis, highlighting the strong links between the exploitation of knowledge and the accumulation of surplus. Therefore we investigate the presence of a new type of Kaldor-Verdoorn law in cognitive capitalism (a virtuous circle among BI, increasing productivity - via knowledge and network externalities - output and employment). As a result, we first point out the ambiguous growth circle of the contemporary capitalism. Secondly we highlight that BI is compatible with the new way of accumulation, based on the exploitation of dynamic scale economies. BI increases productivity, through network (externalities) and learning processes and, at the same time, demand, via consumption level. This double result is not always guaranteed. It depends, on one side, on how much BI positively affects productivity, and the greater this probability, the lower the role played by intellectual property rights and the higher the diffusion of network economies (general intellect and social cooperation); on the other side, it depends on the way BI is financed. These results also depend on the assumption of closed economy, in which financial markets play no role at all.", "keywords": ["basic income", "cognitive capitalism", "crisis", "Fordism", "general intellect", "Kaldor-Verdoorn law", "knowledge", "productivity", "Regulation School"]}

We based our study on the narcissistic admiration and rivalry concept (NARC) and proposed a direct positive effect of leaders' narcissistic rivalry—the maladaptive narcissism dimension—on abusive supervision. In line with trait activation and threatened egotism theory, we also proposed a moderated mediation assuming that leaders high in narcissistic rivalry would be particularly prone to showing abusive supervision in reaction to followers' supervisor-directed deviance, as this form of follower behavior would threaten their self-esteem. We conducted a field study with leader–follower dyads (Study 1) and an experimental vignette study with leaders (Study 2).

The idea of this work is that levels of corruption emerge endogenously as a result of a society-wide coordination game in which ther individual returns to corrupt behavior are a function of how disposed towards corruption the other members of society are perceived as being. An empirical implication of this logic is that if one were to exogenously perturb beliefs about societal levels of corruption upward, willingness to engage in corruption should increase as a consequence. The current paper evaluates this claim by utilizing an information experiment embedded in a large-scale household survey conducted in the Gran Área Metropolitana (GAM) of Costa Rica from October 2013 to April 2014 (n=4200). Changes in beliefs about corruption were induced via the random assignment of an informational display depicting the increasing percentage of Costa Ricans who have experienced or directly observed an act of corruption (from 2006 to 2011). The paper finds that, on average, assignment to this display (relative to the control condition) increased the probability that a respondent would be willing to pay a bribe to a police officer by approximately 0. 04 to 0. 08, thereby providing supporting evidence for the self-fulfilling prophecy hypothesis.", "keywords": ["Corruption"]}

This paper seeks to understand the general failure of such commercialised state strategies, while also explaining how demand and income growth in some notable exceptions can be understood. To this end, a simple demand-led model is presented that suggests that foreign-targeted state aid may lead to beggarthy-neighbour, FDI-driven growth in one economy if certain conditions are met, such as there being sufficiently little policy competition from other countries. It is shown that the exceptional cases tend to be the early movers, i.e. those few economies and special economic zones that engaged in the commercialisation of state sovereignty before the widespread competitive emulation that followed.

The Bulgarian Case — After nearly a decade of profound economic changes and a market transformation the countries in Central and Eastern Europe now face the challenge of development and sustainable growth. The development priorities include achieving a high income growth for their economies by raising investment rates, strengthening technological capacities and skills, and improving the competitiveness of their exports, distributing the benefits of growth equitably by creating more and better employment opportunities. An important factor for reaching these goals is not only the input and national endowments of the country but also the world economic environment and the main economic participants in it as for most of the transition countries (the smaller ones, in particular) the exogenous impetus turns to be the main determinant for the success of the reforms. The reason behind it is the full exhaustion of the ineffective usage of the national resources (natural, human, capital, financial) in the old \"socialist\" model and the great economic and technology gap which has existed between the region and the rest of the developed economic world. The purpose of the paper is to reveal the importance of MNCs activities in Central and Eastern Europe for marketization of the region and for effective integration in the globalizing world economy. The different aspects of MNCs' impact on Bulgarian economy are examined with respect to their new comparative advantages. The main determinants of the investment climate in the country are also studied and the special accent is put on commenting the results of an empirical study of MNCs transaction costs activities in Bulgaria and the critical issues concerning a better investment climate in the country.

It is shown that the policy representation by the Bundestag could be improved using the alternative Third Vote election method. Under the Third Vote, electors cast no votes for parties by name. The electoral ballot consists of questions on topical policy issues ('General speed limit on motorways?'-Yes/No, 'Germany should increase its defense spending?'-Yes/No, etc.), and the parties answer to these questions before the elections - as required by the Wahl-O-Mat, the German voting advice applications. However, the Third Vote is not concerned with individual advices or individual voting intermediation. The electoral ballots are processed to construct the electorate's policy profile with balances of public opinion on all the issues. Then the matching of the parties' profiles with the electorate's profile is measured using the parties' indices of popularity (average percentage of electors represented on all the issues) and universality (percentage of questions when a majority is represented). These indices of representativeness are used instead of the conventional index 'number of votes received' to define the party quotas in the Bundestag. This method is hypothetically applied to reallocate the Bundestag seats to the eligible parties, resulting in a considerable gain in the Bundestag's representativeness.

We further provide a new test for jump detection which has substantially more power than tests based on multipower variation.

The removal of quotas is associated with an increase in the price and frequency of export transactions and with a reduction in average distance of firms' exports. We rationalize our findings with a heterogeneous-firm model of exporting where firms decide which markets to serve as well as the frequency of transactions and the quality of exported products in each market. In response to low-wage competition, the more productive firms increase exports of high-quality products to nearby markets, while the less productive firms drop out from distant and low-income markets.

How nursing home prices affect certified staffing ratios — Many countries limit public and private reimbursement for nursing care costs for social or financial reasons.

The Swiss reimbursement system limits and subsidizes the care price at the cantonal level, which implicitly limits staffing ratios, while the residents cover the nursing home‐specific lodging price privately. To estimate causal effects, we exploit (i) the exogeneity of the Swiss care price regulation, (ii) nursing‐home fixed effects estimations and (iii) instrumental variables for the lodging price. Our estimates show a positive impact of prices on certified staffing ratios. We find that a 10% increase in care prices increases certified staffing ratios by 3–4%. A comparable 10% increase in lodging prices raises certified staffing ratios by 1.5–10% (depending on the model). Our findings highlight that price limits for nursing care impose a limit on staffing ratios.

Attitudes and ways of life do matter even when a lucrative business opportunity exists, especially across national borders. This paper examines which aspects of culture give countries competitive edge in terms of bilateral trade performances. Specifically, do relatively higher scores in certain cultural dimensions have a deterministic effect on bilateral trade performance (terms of trade or bilateral trade balance)? Methodology: We adopt empirical econometric estimation methods on trade data covering 59 countries and 29 years combined with the nine \"Global Leadership and Organizational Behavior Effectiveness (GLOBE)\" culture dimensions, Our estimations were based on Robust Regression Analysis and Ordinary Least Squares methods. Findings: We find that indeed, certain aspects of culture enhance bilateral trade performance/competitiveness. Performance Orientation, Future Orientation, Institutional Collectivism, Gender Egalitarianism, Power Distance and Uncertainty Avoidance improve bilateral trade performance while Assertiveness, Humane Orientation and In-Group Collectivism impair it. Research limitations: Direct measures of international competitiveness are not readily available. So we had to adopt proxies for measuring international competitiveness. Implications: Many countries want to boost international competitiveness. However, in the current world order with multilateral trade agreements under the WTO and increased transferability of technology, governments are clipped in terms of available trade policy options. By understanding which aspects of culture promote bilateral competitiveness and performance, governments could take steps to maximize their competitiveness. For instance, when negotiating trade treaties, policy makers may benefit from the knowledge of culture's impact on competitive advantage when selecting partners.

Our results in the present paper provide exact non-cooperative foundations first, in our Proposition, via weakly subgame perfect equilibria of a game that is a modification of Rubinstein's game, then in our Theorem, via sub-game perfect equilibria of a game that is a further modification of our first game. Moreover, they provide a general rule how to transform approximate support results into exact ones. Finally, we discuss the relation of the above mentioned support results, including our present ones, with mechanism theoretic implementation in (weakly) subgame perfect equilibrium of the Nash solution.

Given that motorcycles comprise almost 80% of vehicle sales in Nepal, a viable alternative to reduce air pollution is driving more fuel-efficient electric alternatives. However, their adoption has been limited due to a gamut of market failures and behavioral anomalies. In this study, we collect rich data on preferences, socio-economic factors and biases of more than 2,000 potential motorcycle buyers in the Kathmandu valley in Nepal. Using a stated choice experiment with randomized information treatments, we evaluate the role of specific behavioral anomalies in determining the stated-preference of consumers on whether they would be willing to buy an electric motorcycle. We find evidence to suggest that cognitive/skills limitations, framing of information, and the affect heuristic play a role in determining the stated-preference of respondents. In particular, displaying qualitative information on the air pollution impact of their choices, and \"priming\" them through impactful photographs and texts could have a positive effect. Furthermore, the results also hint at the importance of gender, health status and cognitive skills in determining the effectiveness of these nudges in promoting the adoption of electric alternatives.

As more secured debt causes larger fire sales, it leads to higher haircuts which further increase the frequency of runs.

Conclusions: The results showed that perceived risk of COVID-19 infection had a positive effect on purchase intention, perceived risk of purchase behavior had a negative impact on purchase intention, and attitude was a mediating variable between perceived risk and purchase intention.

After describing the objectives and the structure of the model, we report a first experiment which explores how the ruggedness of the landscape affects the interplay of local payoff and cognitive considerations (preferred direction) in search. We show that an intermediate search strategy, combining the guidance of local search with a moderate level of non-local obsession, is distinctly advantageous in searching a rugged landscape. We also explore the effects of other considerations, including the objective validity of the preferred direction and the degree of dispersion of firm strategies.

We find that there has so far been a moderate increase in actual protectionist measures to restrict trade through tariff and non-tariff barriers. At the same time, evidence from surveys shows that public pressure for more economic protection has been mounting since the mid-2000s, and has possibly intensified since the start of the financial crisis. However, no World Trade Organization (WTO) member has retreated into widespread trade restrictions or protectionism to date. Our model-based simulations suggest that the impairment of the global flow of trade would hamper the recovery from the crisis, as well as the long-term growth potential of the global economy. At the same time, it is unlikely that protectionism would help to correct existing current account imbalances. Moreover, the countries implementing protectionist measures should expect a deterioration of their international competitiveness, which would further affect the potential for longer-term real GDP growth.", "keywords": ["competitiveness", "financial crisis", "Protectionism", "Trade", "World Trade Organization"]}

Motivation: The sustainability reporting is relatively a new subject in Turkey both in practice and in academic circles. The introduction of Corporate Social Responsibility as a concept in Turkey does not have a long history. The last five years witnessed a significant change in terms of corporate social responsibility (CSR) applications. Increasing number of companies started to implement sustainability accounting and corporate social responsibility practices. Companies began to adopt corporate social responsibility by considering it as a tool for medium- and long-term success. As a reflection of growing interest in sustainability and CSR, the number of NGO's and consultancy firms operating in this field has also increased recently. In 2014, Sustainability Index was created within the Istanbul Stock Exchange (ISE). Idea: The understanding of the social responsibility applications and priority areas vary between different countries depending on their economic, social and political dynamics. In order to see the intra-regional variations, in this paper, we compare corporate social responsibility and sustainability applications in Turkey and in the neighboring regions by selecting Russia and Greece in the same region. Data: For the analysis, we collect recent sustainability reports of Turkish companies from GRI database and make a content analysis to evaluate practical applications of CSR and sustainability in Turkey. Then, we discuss corporate social responsibility applications in Russia and Greece. In the first part of our paper we examine corporate social responsibility and sustainability applications in Turkey by making an analysis of sustainability reports and CSR activities in Turkey. In the following part we discuss corporate social responsibility applications in the neighboring regions and make a comparison with Turkey. To this end, sustainability reports of Russian Federation and Greek companies in GRI database are analyzed for CSR activities. In the final part of our paper, we make a comparative analysis of CSR applications in Turkey and in the neighboring regions. Findings: The final analysis of CSR in Turkey and neighboring countries supports the idea that understanding of CSR varies in different countries depending on their social structure and economic development level.", "keywords": ["Corporate social responsibility", "sustainability accounting", "sustainability index"]}

In our natural laboratory, the Azores Island of São Miguel, an important share of tourists identifies adventure, leisure and touch with nature, as the main reasons for the visit. In this sense, footpaths are an important tool to promote environmental and social education, encouraging the observation and improving the knowledge about the nature and endorsing greater respect for our heritage. Its use can contribute to the satisfaction of tourists, promoting tourism and the region's development during their movements on the tourism network, tourists appreciate different types of attractions and need the support of a set of facilities. Tourist decisions aren?t always done in a rational way, emotions add even more complexity to the human decision process. The movement of tourists within a destination and the level of satisfaction that they can achieve, depends on factors related to tourist characteristics, like the time budgets, preferences or destination knowledge, and destination features related to attractions characteristics or accessibility level. In order to offer relevant tourism products, stakeholders need to understand how tourists take their decisions and what their preferences are. That knowledge will be able to build optimized tourism products that meet the tourists? preferences and facilities that allow the use of the network in an optimal way by the different tourist profiles. The existence of a mathematical model that incorporates the main factors that explain the movement of independent tourists within a destination, in a dynamic way, will make possible the creation of an adaptable software tool. This tool will meet the specific needs of tourism and the needs of regional business and government, according to their endogenous features, improving the optimization of investments in transport networks and the infrastructure that supports tourism related activities.

This study investigates the potential reasons that stop smallholder farming households from adopting genetically engineered seeds (Bt cotton and improved wheat seeds), herbicides resulting from cutting-edge technologies, and no-tillage farming. Utilizing original farm household-level data from 275 smallholder farming households in Pakistan, we employ multivariate probit models. The results show that the adoption of innovative technologies is not an isolated, separate process but a concoction of available technologies and cropping patterns. The estimates of the multivariate probit models show that farm machinery index, off-farm income sources, and farmers’ education facilitate technology adoption. The observations and estimates indicate that a lack of agricultural extension service contacts is present, which slows down the farmers’ adoption of agricultural technological inputs. Therefore, promoting the role of agricultural extension services (qualitatively and quantitatively) is likely to play a role in multiple technology adoption. Furthermore, the significant effect of off-farm employment shows that the lack of financial resources is another factor slowing the adoption of innovative technologies, which depends on liquidity for necessary expenditures.", "keywords": ["agricultural extension", "off-farm income sources", "smallholder farming households"]}

We provide evidence that large shocks to external conditions affect the firm's personnel policies, and show that the burden of the shock is not evenly spread across the workforce. The firm takes advantage of a high-inflationary environment and of a fall in workers' outside options after the financial crisis and cuts real wages.

This study employs a dynamic panel model with the two-step system generalized methods of moments (system GMM) technique using 77 listed energy firms of South Asian emerging economies (i.e. Bangladesh, India, & Pakistan) covering from 2015 to 2019.

The study results also find that earnings management plays a complementary mediating role (i.e. partial mediation) in the association between gender diversity and energy firms’ performance. This research demonstrates the economic value of having female directors on corporate boards by strengthening companies’ governance structure and decreasing earnings management. On the issue of board gender diversity policy, this research offers vital practical information for South Asian regulators, particularly in the energy sector.

The three models allow us to consider three different forms of price differentiation and discrimination in networks: by user class, by origin-destination pair, and by route. We generalize the existing literature, in which groups usually only differ in their value of time, and hence, there is no distinction between differentiation and discrimination. In our models, users may also have different marginal external costs; we show how these two differences interact. We also show how non-differentiated and non-discriminatory policies may increase or decrease welfare, and that non-discrimination can be worse than non-differentiation. The network models show that results obtained for a single-link network can be generalized to a situation where operators price-discriminate or differentiate based on users origins and destinations, but not directly to a situation in which differentiation is based on route choices.", "keywords": ["networks", "price differentiation", "price discrimination", "transport"]}

The second part focuses on the relations between central government decisions on taxation and its influence on savings, investments and economic growth. In this part we will find selected analyses of the impact of taxes on economic growth based on the examples of OECD countries. Finally, the last part of the work is a study on fiscal level and tax system structures and economic growth. In this part the authors checks two points of view on taxation. The first is that a low level tax burden is conducive to economic growth, and the second emphasizes negative consequences of decreasing budget tax revenues. The article shows both theoretical and empirical points of view on taxation and influence of government taxation decisions on the economy.", "keywords": ["economic growth", "fiscal policy", "personal income tax"]}

The equilibrium tax rate can be not only positive but also increasing in the degree of mobility of unskilled workers. This is mainly because an initial change in migration flows induced by an increase in the tax rate brings about a higher wage for skilled workers and a lower wage for unskilled workers, which offsets the initial adverse effect. We also show that in contrast to the conventional wisdom in the literature of tax competition decreasing the tax rate invites not only skilled workers but also unskilled workers; unskilled workers always chase skilled workers at the equilibrium.

Complexity theory includes the tenet that most antecedent conditions are neither sufficient nor necessary for the occurrence of a specific outcome. Identifying a firm by individual antecedents (i.e., non-innovative versus highly innovative, small versus large size in sales or number of employees, or serving local versus international markets) provides shallow information in modeling specific outcomes (e.g., high sales growth or high profitability)-even if directional analyses (e.g., regression analysis, including structural equation modeling) indicates that the independent (main) effects of the individual antecedents relate to outcomes directionally-because firm (case) anomalies almost always occur to main effects. Examples: a number of highly innovative firms have low sales while others have high sales and a number of non-innovative firms have low sales while others have high sales. Breaking-away from the current dominant logic of directionality testing-null hypotheses statistic testing (NHST)-to embrace somewhat precise outcome testing (SPOT) is necessary for extracting highly useful information about the causes of anomalies-associations opposite to expected and \"statistically significant\" main effects. The study of anomalies extends to identifying the occurrences of four-corner strategy outcomes: firms doing well in favorable circumstances, firms doing badly in favorable circumstances, firms doing well in unfavorable circumstances, and firms doing badly in unfavorable circumstances. Models of four-corner strategy outcomes advances strategic management beyond the current dominant logic of directional modeling of single outcomes.", "keywords": ["Anomalies", "Complexity", "Directionality", "Modeling", "Outcomes", "Strategy"]}

However, it is not yet understood how they interact in shaping human welfare and food security, how their interaction shapes gendered outcomes, or how social protection systems can mitigate their impact. To address these knowledge gaps, we first examine how household food insecurity relates to conflict and climate shocks and whether these associations are gender-sensitive. Second, we test what mechanisms can reduce the negative impacts of these shocks. Our empirical analysis relies on novel survey data of 7,908 rural households collected across 14 states in Sudan in 2022. Sudan currently faces floods, droughts, and violent conflict affecting agricultural production and food supply. We find that climate shocks do not significantly affect food consumption scores (FCS), while exposure to violent conflict leads to a substantial decrease in FCS. Both productive and nonproductive assets increase FCS for all households, especially female-headed households. Longer distances to agricultural input and output markets correlate with lower FCS, particularly for maleheaded households. Women's social group membership positively impacts on FCS for femaleheaded households. However, women do not receive additional benefits from other social networks during climate and conflict exposure, while male-headed households benefit from all types of social networks. Income diversification is identified as a key strategy for improving FCS, particularly for female-headed households during conflict. Informal cash transfers significantly improve FCS, especially for female-headed households. In contrast, formal cash transfers negatively correlate with FCS, although they positively impact on male-headed households during violent conflict.

In particular, we examine three types of household depending on how the household's current consumption reference level relates to a given threshold which is equal to the average discounted endowment income. The first type of household has a relatively low reference level (less ambitious household) and can avoid relative consumption losses in both periods. The second type of household (balanced household) always consumes exactly its reference levels. The third type of household has a relatively high reference level (more ambitious household) and cannot avoid to incur relative consumption losses, either now or in the future. Note that these households may act very differently from one another and thus there will often be a diversity of behavior. For all three types we examine how the household reacts to changes in: income (e.g., income fall caused by recession or taxation of endowment income), persistence to consumption, the first period reference level and the degree of loss aversion. Among others we find that the household increases its exposure to risky assets in good economic times if it is less ambitious and in bad economic times if it is more ambitious. We also find that in some cases more income can lead to less happiness. In addition, the less ambitious household and the more ambitious household with a higher time preference will be less happy with a rising persistence in consumption while the more ambitious household with a lower time preference will be happier if it sticks more to its consumption habits.

The  optimal tax policy  in this setting depends on the relative price difference.  In a two sector economy  capital and labour margins are interdependent,  which is why  a difference between investment good’s  price and consumption good’s price allows the government to tax capital income in one sector and  undo the tax distortion by differential labour income taxation. This policy serves efficiency purpose as  it restores production efficiency. For instance, if investment goods are more expensive than consumption goods,  it is optimal to  tax capital income in consumption sector,  and  set zero capital  income tax  and lower labour income tax  in investment sector. This policy discourages work and  investment  in consumption sector, and encourages  agents  to  shift capital and working  time  to  investment sector.

But recently aid quality has come to the fore, by which is meant the efficiency of the aid delivery process. This paper focuses on one process problem, the proliferation of aid projects and the associated administrative burden for recipients. It models aid delivery as a set of production activities (projects) with two inputs—the donor’s aid and a recipient-side resource—and two outputs—development and ‘throughput’, which represents the private benefits of implementing projects, from kickbacks to career rewards for disbursing. The donor’s allocation of aid across projects is taken as exogenous while the recipient’s allocation of its resource is modelled and subject to a budget constraint. Unless the recipient cares purely about development, an aid increase can reduce development in some circumstances. Sunk costs, representing for the recipient the administrative burden of donor meetings and reports, are introduced. Using data on the distribution of projects by size and country, simulations of aid increases are run in order to examine how the project distribution evolves, how the recipient’s resource allocation responds, and how this affects development if the recipient is not a pure development optimizer. A threshold is revealed beyond which marginal aid effectiveness drops sharply. It occurs when development maximization calls for the recipient to withdraw from some donor-backed projects, but the recipient does not, for the sake of throughput. Donors can push back this threshold by moving to larger projects if there are scale economies in aid projects.", "keywords": ["absorptive capacity", "foreign aid", "project proliferation"]}

A review of organic and fair-trade certification — The growth of ethical consumerism in developed countries has led to increased imports of environmentally and socially certified products produced by the poor in developing countries, which could potentially contribute towards the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Among these, organic products and fair-trade products are among the rapidly growing 'ethical trade' products. This market development trend utilizes certification systems that ensure the impartiality of assessing products produced in developing countries. This paper assesses how the conditions under organic certification and fair-trade certification directly and indirectly contribute to the achievement of the MDG targets. The study finds that organic certification substantially contributes to MDG1 (poverty and hunger) and MDG7 (environmental sustainability). Farmers who follow certification requirements stand to be rewarded with substantial improvements in farming systems, premium prices, and better market access. In addition, by eliminating the risk of exposure to toxic agrochemicals, it directly contributes to health-related MDGs. Moreover, as organic agriculture contributes to mitigating climate change, certified organic farmers with established farm-monitoring systems are in better positions to receive compensation for soil carbon sequestration, when the methodology is approved. However, organic certification doesn't clearly address social aspects, which fair-trade certification directly deals with. Fairtrade certification directly targets smallholders in marginal areas, resulting in broader impacts on other non-income MDGs. In addition, financial benefits for fair-trade certification are immediate, as organic certification often requires a transition period before full certification is granted. Thus, in achieving the MDG targets, a combination of organic and fair-trade certification is recommended. This paper concludes that for this market-based development scheme to broaden its poverty impacts, public sector support in harmonizing standards, building up the capacity of certifiers, developing infrastructure development, and innovating alternative certification systems will be required.", "keywords": ["Millennium Development Goals"]}

This study hopes to explore this paradox by looking at the factors that affect demand for broadband services. To achieve this, the relationship between overall broadband adoption and two basic demand factors, namely price of internet services and presence of a competitor in the form of wireless broadband, was examined over a 12-year period. The findings suggest that the lag in adoption can be attributed to both a higher demand for wireless connectivity and high broadband contract prices, while network effects may play a positive role in diffusion.

Our estimation results indicate that using real time instead of ex post data leads to higher estimated inflation coefficients while the opposite is true for the output gap coefficients. If real time data forecasts for the current period are used (since actual data become available with a lag), this empirical pattern is even strengthened in the sense of even increasing the inflation response but lowering the reaction to the output gap while the reverse is true if 'true' forecasts of real time data for several periods are employed.", "keywords": ["real time data", "Taylor rule"]}

However, given the dramatic supplementation of SSI benefits in some states, a migration response to these benefits cannot be dismissed, and migration that is associated with SSI benefits can lead to bias in estimates of the effects of SSI benefits on labor supply; depending on retirement and migration behavior, the disincentive effects can be overstated or understated. Migration responses to SSI benefits are also important in their own right, as another instance of the potential problem of welfare magnets. We fail to find any statistically significant evidence that older individuals likely to be eligible for SSI in the near future, or already eligible for SSI, are more likely to move from low benefit to high benefit states. These findings are robust to the use of a number of different comparison groups to try to capture the state-to-state migration patterns that exist independently of a response to SSI.

Findings The SWOT analysis identified several strengths (e.g. advanced infrastructure, rising number of new entrants and contribution to the local economy), weaknesses (e.g. lack of digital culture and training and a dearth of expertise), opportunities (e.g. supportive government initiatives and evolution of the mobile internet) and threats (e.g. changing customer expectations and limited financing facilities). The MSMEs' perception towards micro-takāful and challenges in the adoption of takāful were also identified.

Given this gap, this paper, therefore, tests empirically a sticky-price model under the assumption of near-rational expectations on two different inflation episodes in the Turkish economy. The near-rational expectations as described by optimal univariate expectations where agents use information on past inflation optimally while data on other variables are ignored, not only fit the data for both periods but also are not subject to Lucas critique.

A detailed Google-form-based survey was conducted on 231 small cafés and restaurants in Maharashtra's major cities that opened after COVID-19 (Mumbai, Pune, Nagpur, and Thane) to collect primary data. The data was analysed using the AMOS (Analysis of Moment Structures) program. The study concludes that digital branding plays a crucial role as an independent branding strategy and enhances the performance of specialty eatery start-ups in the post-pandemic era. Furthermore, the study highlights the significant mediating effect of digital support and awareness on the adoption intention of digital branding. This research is the first of its kind to examine the intention of startups in the specialty eatery industry to use digital branding to reach their intended audience. The study utilizes a quantitative approach, contributing to the respective research area that has been predominantly qualitative in previous studies regarding digital branding adoption. The findings of this research provide valuable insights for specialty eatery start-ups and other related businesses to enhance their digital branding strategies.", "keywords": ["adoption intention", "awareness", "digital branding", "digital support", "independent branding", "specialty eatery", "start-ups"]}

Second we disclose the latent probability of macroprudential tightening from the binary information of policy episodes, using an instrumental variable probit model estimated by conditional maximum likelihood with heteroscedasticity robust standard errors. Lastly we estimate the dynamic impact of monetary policy and macroprudential measures using a panel VAR, incorporating the latent probability of tightening episodes, credit growth, industrial production growth, loan rates, inflation and credit growth volatilities into the endogenous system of equations. We conclude that macroprudential tightening is effective in dampening credit growth, credit growth volatility and reducing consumer price inflation.

Evidence from the refugee crisis in Germany — We apply difference-in-differences regressions to study the impact of the 2015 refugee crisis in Germany on the culturally closer diaspora of existing immigrants originating from Turkey and Middle- Eastern and North-African countries (TMENA). Our identification allows us to emphasize the role of immigrants’ culture in estimating immigration’s socio-economic impact. Additionally, we distinguish between the labor demand and labor supply effects associated with immigration, which enables us to reflect on the ambiguous labor market impact of immigration suggested in the existing literature. In particular, we find that TMENA immigrants experienced a substantial reduction in unemployment in 2015, consistent with the differential demand shock induced by refugees’ consumption of culturally similar goods and services. However, the unemployment effects dissipated starting in 2016, coinciding with refugees’ delayed yet incremental labor market integration. We also consider the social impact of the refugee crisis and find that while worries about immigration increased among all respondents, the increases were statistically significantly smaller among TMENA immigrants, primarily due to their cultural proximity to arriving refugees. Our results suggest that TMENA immigrants’ assimilation of German identity was unaffected by the refugee crisis.", "keywords": ["existing immigrants"]}

Results show that carmakers differ in their focal digital mobility value propositions, based mainly on the carmakers' own mobility strategies. Volkswagen exhibits an integral proposition with personalized services, while Stellantis is focusing on electric mobility and its solutions, Toyota on autonomous and connectivity services, and Honda on a user-centric perspective via connected and shared mobility. The main sources of income are multiple personalized services linked to connectivity that specifically provide driver assistance, along with remote and digital platform services. Those carmakers pursuing sustainable, autonomous, or shared mobility strategies find their primary income sources in services like remote electric driving, autonomous door-to-door deliveries, and car-sharing. Such services are deployed not only due to technical resources, such as digital skills and data exchange systems, but primarily through organizational capabilities like a \"team-player mentality\" and a customer-focused vision. Finally, differences in sustainability have been highlighted, but in general terms, all manufacturers are striving to address the battery and charging-point issue through various business models to promote electric mobility.

Currently, there is a lack of studies in primary health care (PHC) that assess the relationship between the quality and the level of performance of the Primary Health Care Teams. In Portugal, those teams are monitored through the Global Performance Index (GPI), which demonstrates, through a score, the procedures and results obtained by electronic records and the metrics defined for each indicator.

Natural disasters and also other shocks require well-developed social protection systems that are able to cushion the economic consequences for those most vulnerable to these events. Many international and national organisations advocate for 'Adaptive Social Protection' (ASP) which links social policy with strategies on disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation. The main emphasis is on improving households' ability to prepare for, cope with, and adapt to shocks. This paper uses the tax-benefit microsimulation model INDOMOD to analyse the adaptiveness of the Indonesian social protection system both under normal conditions, and after a simulated hypothetical income shock caused by a natural disaster, using El Niño as a showcase. El Niño is a climate phenomenon that has the ability to change the global atmospheric circulation and as such to influence temperature and precipitation around the world. The drought caused in severely hit regions in Indonesia leads to a disruption of established crop patterns and harvest losses. The dry periods furthermore often cause forest fires affecting the livelihood of those employed in the forestry, transportation, tourism, and public health sector. The analysis focuses first on how the current tax-benefit system prepares individuals and households for a shock (Section 6.1). Secondly, it tests whether the level of preparedness improves after introducing a hypothetical policy reform by augmenting existing benefits and by introducing two new categorical benefits for old-age and disabled individuals ('augmented reform') (Section 6.2). Next, the analysis stress-tests the welfare system by introducing an income shock caused by a hypothetical El Nino event. Based on information from previous events, we simulate a labour market income shock to individuals living in regions more likely to be significantly hit and working in sectors affected by such an event. The analysis explores the impact of the income shock under the current tax-benefit system, under the augmented hypothetical reform and under an additional hypothetical reform that introduces emergency benefits in addition to the existing policy design ('reactive reform') (Section 6.3).", "keywords": ["Households", "Microsimulation", "Poverty", "Social Policy"]}

I simulate how farms would respond to these measures using a case study farm modeling approach and data for different farm types in Germany.

Both authors suggest using the annual wealth tax to supplement the redistributional effects of the income tax, assigning it a role as a redistributional backstop mechanism. However, when measured against annual income, the wealth tax is often not delivering the expected effects – a large share of the tax burden falls on people with low income. We argue that instead of using yearly income, one should measure wealth tax burdens with respect to individual lifetime income in family dynasties. Using rich Norwegian administrative data, we describe how a lifetime-dynastic income concept can be established.

Its critics have raised questions as to whom, if anyone, reins in the Federal Reserve if and when its policies are misguided or abusive. This paper traces the principal changes in governance of the Federal Reserve over its history. These changes have, for the most part, developed in the wake of economic upheavals, when Fed policy has been challenged. The aim is to identify relevant issues regarding governance and to establish a basis for change, if needed. It describes the governance mechanism established by the Federal Reserve Act in 1913, traces the passing of this mechanism in the 1920s and 1930s, and assays congressional efforts to expand oversight in the 1970s. It also considers the changes in Fed policies induced by the financial crisis of 2007-09 and the impact of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010.

Existing research on this shift in fertility behavior points to economic aspects and increased levels of uncertainty as important drivers. However, in this debate little attention has been paid to how the relevance of individual- and contextual-level dimensions for understanding the new fertility patterns varies by level of urbanization. This is surprising given that urban and rural areas not only differ strongly in fertility timing and levels, but also in economic conditions. Our paper fills this important research gap by analyzing rich register data from Finland using multi-level event history models to study the transition to first birth among younger (under age 30) and older (ages 30 or older) women. We show that urban–rural differences in the transition to parenthood are particularly pronounced among younger women. In addition, the results indicate that economic circumstances and related uncertainties are more relevant for understanding first births probabilities for younger women than older women. Finally, among younger women, the relevance of economic circumstances and related uncertainties seems to be most relevant in the capital region of Helsinki and urban areas compared to semiurban and rural areas.

Design/methodology/approach The essence of the theoretical framework of this study is to address the effect of the electoral system as an independent variable on the party system as a dependent variable. The starting point for that framework is to reassess the \"Duverger's law,\" which appeared since the early 1950s and has influenced the foregoing relationship, and then to review the literature on a new phase that tried to provide a more accurate mechanism for determining the number of parties and their relative weight, whether in terms of electoral votes or parliamentary seats. This means that researchers began to use a measure called the effective number of parties (ENP) for Laakso and Taagepera since 1979. The study elaborates the general concepts of the electoral system and the party system. It used Laakso, Taagepera index of the \"ENP\" to measure the phenomenon of fragmentation party during the five legislative elections from 1997 to 2017 in Algeria. Findings The results of the study reveal that the proportional representation electoral system - beside other factors - had clear impacts on the fragmentation of the Algerian party system by all standards, whether on the level of the apparent rise in the number of the parties represented in the Algerian parliament from 10 parties in 1997 election to 36 parties in 2017 election or according to the index of Laakso and Taagepera (ENP).

However, living through a famine early in life does not necessarily imply a lack of nutrition during that age interval, and vice versa, and in this sense the observed difference at most provides a qualitative assessment of the average causal effect of a nutritional shortage, which is the parameter of interest.

This article examines the spatial distribution of hydrogen frontrunner projects in light of regional heterogeneity. It reveals a pattern that exhibits clear core regions but is only partly consistent with the localisation of current production and usage potentials. For a rapid ramp-up of hydrogen markets, European policymakers should make greater efforts to incentivise capacity formation in regions with high potential, by harmonising national levies affecting hydrogen supply chains and promoting the build-up of a cross-regional hydrogen transport infrastructure.

The research sought specifically to determine how these perceptions are influenced by their organizations' ethical infrastructure and corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from 134 HR professionals using an anonymous structured questionnaire. Findings: The scope of organizations' ethics programs and the degree of importance given to developing an ethical infrastructure were found to predict the level of acceptance of unethical HRM practices related to discrimination. These practices are also less acceptable to professionals from organizations that are perceived as more socially responsible regarding their employees. Research limitations/implications: Additional studies with larger samples are needed to determine more clearly not only the influence of contextual determinants, but also the practical consequences of high levels of acceptance of unethical practices in HRM. Practical implications: Organizations can decrease their HR professionals' acceptance of ethically questionable HRM practices by developing and emphasizing a strong ethical infrastructure and CSR practices, especially those affecting employees. Originality/value: HR professionals' perceptions of ethical issues have rarely been analyzed using empirically tested methods. By surveying HR professionals, this study contributes to a fuller understanding of their perceptions regarding the ethics of their own practices. The results show that contextual determinants play an important role in predicting the level of acceptance of unethical HRM practices, especially those leading to discrimination.", "keywords": ["Corporate social responsibility", "Ethical infrastructure", "Ethics", "Unethical practices"]}

Studies using cross-sectional data have proposed various ways of measuring and standardizing for need, but inevitably much of the inter-individual variation in needs remains unobserved in cross-sections. This paper exploits panel data methods to improve the measurement by including the time-invariant part of unobserved heterogeneity into the need-standardization procedure. Using latent class hurdle models for GP and specialist visits estimated on 8 annual waves of the European Community Household Panel we compute indices of horizontal equity that partition total income-related variation in use into a need- and a non-need related part, not only for the observed but also for the unobserved but time-invariant component. We also propose and compare a more conservative index of horizontal inequity to the conventional statistic. We find that many of the cross-country comparative results appear fairly robust to the panel data test, although the panel-based methods lead to significantly higher estimates of horizontal inequity for most countries. This confirms that better estimation and control for need often reveals more pro-rich distributions of doctor utilisation.", "keywords": ["health care utilisation", "inequity", "panel data"]}

A discrete choice experiment — Background: There are unresolved procedural and medical problems in the care of diabetes, which cause high costs for health systems. These include the inadequate glycemic adjustment, care gaps, therapeutic inertia, and a lack of motivation. Personalized diabetes management can be seen as a kind of “standard process” that provides both physicians and patients with a framework. The aim of this empirical survey is the evaluation of patient preferences regarding personalized diabetes management. The purpose of this experiment is to demonstrate the properties of the programs that are relevant for the choice of insulin-based therapy regimens for patients with type II diabetes mellitus.                             Methods           A discrete choice experiment (DCE) was applied to identify preferences for a personalized diabetes management in patients with type II diabetes mellitus. Six attributes were included. The DCE was conducted in June 2017 using a fractional factorial design, and the statistical data analysis used random effect logit models.                             Results           N = 227 patients (66.1% male) were included. The preference analysis showed dominance for the attribute “occurrence of severe hypoglycemias per year” [level difference (LD) 2765]. Preference analysis also showed that participants weight the “risk of myocardial infarction (over 10 years)” (LD 1.854) highest among the side effects. Within the effectiveness criterion of “change in the long-term blood glucose level (HbA1c)” a change at an initial value of 9.5% (LD 1.146) is weighted slightly higher than changes at 7.5% (LD 1.141). Within the random parameter logit estimation, all coefficients proved to be significantly different from zero at the level p ≤ 0.01. The latent class analysis shows three heterogeneous classes, each showing clearly different weights of the therapeutic properties. This results in a clear three-folding: for 1/3 of the respondents the change of the long-term blood sugar (HbA1c value) is the top objective. Another third is solely interested in the short-term effectiveness of the therapy in the sense of the occurrence of severe hypoglycemias per year. The last third of the interviewees finally focuses on the follow-up regarding cardiovascular events. Overall, there were five structural and personality traits which have an influence on the respective probability of the class membership.                             Discussion/conclusion           This study identifies and weights the key decision-making criteria for optimal management of diabetes from the perspective of patients. It was shown that the effectiveness of a care program is the most important from the perspective of the patient and avoiding severe a hypoglycemia has the greatest influence on the choice. The risk of myocardial infarction as a follow-up disease and the long-term adjustment of the blood glucose follow the importance. In the analysis of possible subgroup differences by means of latent class analysis, it was found that three preference patterns exist within the sample. The generated preference data can be used for the design of personalized management approaches.

Surprisingly, these two exogenous constructs: shared norms and shared values do directly influence shared goals and enhance employee self-efficacy. Additionally, shared goals enhance employee efficacy which subsequently leads to sustained customer satisfaction.

The model assumes that there are two types of representative agents in the financial sector, which are: productive banks and financial intermediates. The productive banks supply a financial service, which is an exchange technology service to households and financial intermediates receive savings fund from savers and offer loans to borrowers. The monetary expansions are increased banking costs through the rate of inflation. It leads households to use more exchange credit relative to cash at the goods market. Since the number of savings funds is equal to the number of exchange credits used at the goods market, money injections are lower the nominal interest rate on saving as the saving fund increases with exchange credit. By assuming that firms are the only borrowers at the capital market from Fuerst (1992), a lower nominal interest rate on the saving fund reduces the marginal cost of labour and increases labour demand. Meanwhile, the increasing marginal cost of money through the expected inflation effect has a negative effect on labour supply. With labour demand dominating labour supply effects, both output and employment increase with monetary expansion. The paper is able to generate a decreasing nominal interest rate with an increasing money supply with an absence of limited participation monetary shocks from Lucas (1990); and by allowing firms to borrow wage bills payment from financial intermediates, it examines the positive response of aggregate output subject to monetary expansion under flexible price framework.", "keywords": ["interest rates"]}

In addition, such improvements yield relatively steeper expansionary patterns in resource-rich economies in the longer run. We test these predictions using a panel of U.S. states and counties. Our identification strategy rests on geographically-entrenched differences in resource endowments, and the adoption of plausibly exogenous technology shocks at the national level. Our core estimates corroborate our predictions. First, we document persistent differences in the elasticity of substitution between capital and labor across the natural-resource dimension. Second, we find that an increase in TFP is on impact contractionary in resource-rich states, but is non-contractionary (at worst) in resource-poor ones.

These changes are also of relevance for the energy sector in Germany. An energy sector that in the course of the German \"Energiewende\", also has to deal with a fundamental shift in energy supply from fossil fuel to renewable energies in the next decades. Based on a synthesis of the current knowledge regarding the possible influences of climate change on the German energy sector along its value-added chain, the paper points out, that the possible impacts of a changing climate should be taken into account in the upcoming infrastructure projects in the course of the Energiewende. The main question here is, whether adaptation options will be implemented voluntarily by companies or not. The paper argues that this has to be the case, when the measure is a private good. If, on the contrary, the measure is a public good, additional incentives are needed. For the German energy sector, the paper shows, that governmental intervention are for example justifiable regarding measures to adapt the grid infrastructure as a critical infrastructure that needs to be protected against current and future impacts of climate change.", "keywords": ["adaptation", "climate change", "energy sector", "mitigation"]}

The Puzzle of Rising U.S. Unemployment Persistence — The persistence of U.S. unemployment has risen with each of the last three recessions, raising the specter that future U.S. recessions might look more like the Eurosclerosis experience of the 1980s than traditional V-shaped recoveries of the past. In this paper, we revisit possible explanations for this rising persistence. First, we argue that financial shocks do not systematically lead to more persistent unemployment than monetary policy shocks, so these cannot explain the rising persistence of unemployment. Second, monetary and fiscal policies can account for only part of the evolving unemployment persistence. Therefore, we turn to a third class of explanations: propagation mechanisms. We focus on factors consistent with four other cyclical patterns which have evolved since the early 1980s: a rising cyclicality in long-term unemployment, lower regional convergence after downturns, rising cyclicality in disability claims, and missing disinflation. These factors include declining labor mobility, changing age structures, and the decline in trust among Americans. To determine how these factors affect unemployment persistence, this paper exploits regional variation in labor market outcomes across Western Europe and North America during 1970-1990, in contrast to most previous work focusing either on cross-country variation or regional variation within countries. The results suggest that only cultural factors can account for the rising persistence of unemployment in the U.S., but the evolution in mobility and demographics over time should have more than offset the effects of culture.", "keywords": ["demographics", "labor mobility", "trust", "unemployment persistence"]}

In the model, low-frequency agents adopt trading rules based on chrono- logical time and can switch between fundamentalist and chartist strategies. On the contrary, high-frequency traders activation is event-driven and depends on price fluctuations. High-frequency traders use directional strategies to exploit market in- formation produced by low-frequency traders. Monte-Carlo simulations reveal that the model replicates the main stylized facts of financial markets. Furthermore, we find that the presence of high-frequency trading increases market volatility and plays a fundamental role in the generation of flash crashes. The emergence of flash crashes is explained by two salient characteristics of high-frequency traders, i.e., their ability to i) generate high bid-ask spreads and ii) synchronize on the sell side of the limit order book.

Our results indicate an important role played by union wage spillovers in lowering wages over the 1980-2010 period.

As shown by our analysis as well as in other literature, the incomes of ethnic minorities have always been lower than those of Han. However, the income gap between ethnic minorities and Han narrowed during the 2002-2013 period in atypical ethnic areas. At the same time, it should be noted that during this period inequality increased more for ethnic minorities than it did for Han. Our decomposition of the inequality index shows that the income gap between Han and ethnic minorities can mainly be attributed to factors such as household characteristics and residence location rather than ethnic identity. Between 2002 and 2013 the pattern of poverty changed both for Han and ethnic minorities, but the changes in absolute poverty and relative poverty were the opposite. At the absolute poverty level, the poverty rate, poverty depth, and poverty strength narrowed. But in terms of relative poverty, the poverty rate, poverty depth, and poverty strength increased. Descriptive analysis reveals that ethnic differences in terms of poverty narrowed from 2002 to 2013. Regression analysis suggests that this might be attributed to the fact that ethnic minorities are mainly located in less-developed regions where their ethnic identity does not make any difference. In fact, when controlling for the regional variables, the level of poverty among Han is even more serious than that among ethnic minorities. It is also worth noting that the coefficient of education among ethnic minorities is significantly larger than that among Han, indicating that the development of education may be a very effective anti-poverty strategy for ethnic minorities.", "keywords": ["China", "poverty", "rural"]}

First and for reasonable parameters, the old typically bear a larger burden of the risk in productivity surprises, if old-age risk-aversion is smaller than life risk aversion, and vice versa. Thus, it is not necessarily the case that the young ensure smooth consumption of the old. Second, consumption of the young and the old always move in the same direction, even for population growth shocks. This result is in contrast to the result of a fully-funded decentralized system without risk-sharing between generations. Third, persistent increases in longevity will lead to lower total consumption of the old (and thus certainly lower per-period consumption of the old) as well as the young as well as higher work effort of the young.

Energy prices change substantially and unpredictably, causing large and uncertain movements in revenues. Adjusting to these movements typically involves economic, social and political costs. Alberta government revenues are considerably more volatile than the revenues of other provinces, but Alberta’s own-source revenues less royalty payments are of similar size and volatility as those of other provinces. Several methods to reduce the volatility of revenues are assessed. An often-suggested method, tax base diversification (for example, use of a retail sales tax), is shown to have a minor effect on overall revenue volatility since Alberta’s royalty revenues are such a large share of total own-source revenues. Revenue smoothing using futures and options markets can be expensive, is associated with significant political risks, and cannot eliminate all revenue volatility. The Canadian dollar tends to appreciate (depreciate) when energy prices rise (fall), so exchange rate movements have smoothed Alberta government revenues, although not by a large amount. A simulation using Alberta data shows that a revenue savings fund could significantly reduce revenue volatility. This type of fund leads to greater revenue stability because the revenue it contributes to the budget in any particular year is based on revenues averaged over prior years.

We examine the impact of three previously unexplored legislation: seating, health and safety, and night-work regulations. Given that not all states adopted these laws, and the staggered nature of adoption, we rely on a difference-in-differences strategy design to estimate the effects on female gainful employment. Our findings indicate that laws regulating health and safety conditions and restricting women's night work increased the likelihood of female employment by about 4% to 8%, accounting for about 10% to 20% from the total increase during our period of analysis. Examining heterogeneous effects reveals that younger and married women without children witnessed the largest increase in the likelihood of employment. We also document that native, higher-class and literate women were also incentivized to join the workforce. Women's labor supply in the decades under consideration has been estimated to be quite inelastic with respect to own wage. Nevertheless, we find sizable labor force participation responses to the female-specific labor regulation we study. This indicates that the legislation must have shifted women's labor supply curves, either because it made jobs more pleasant, or because it improved perceptions about how respectable it is for a woman to work in the labor market. Both channels would reduce disutility from work, and increase labor supply at any given wage level.

However, HL is often insufficient in individuals suffering from COPD. Therefore, this study investigates which factors are associated with HL and whether patients with varying HL states desire different support in digital health interventions to better manage COPD-specific symptoms. Methods: In total, 203 participants completed a web-based survey that collected information on patient's health-related quality of life (HRQoL), possible impairments, and areas of improvement in their daily lives. The HLS-EU-Q16 was applied to assess HL. A chi-square test and an analysis of variances were performed to compare variable characteristics across COPD patients with dif-ferent HL. An ordinal logistic regression was used to identify variables significantly associated with HL. Based on the survey's responses, the patients' desire for daily support were identified. Results: Of the 203 participants, 53.2% demonstrated sufficient HL, 27.6% indicated problematic HL, and 19.2% displayed inadequate HL. Significant differences in the requirement of support in daily life (χ²=0.032), length of diagnosis (χ²=0.015), and confidence in medication intake (χ²﹤0.001) were observable. Furthermore, significant differences in age (p﹤0.001), EQ-5D-5L (p﹤0.001), EQ-VAS (p﹤0.001), and CAT (p=0.004) were identified. The ordinal logistic regression revealed age and the EQ-5D-5L as significantly associated with HL. COPD patients expressed consistent pref-erences for support in digital health interventions, irrespective of their HL state. Conclusion: The study reveals that age and HRQoL, represented by the EQ-5D-5L, are signifi-cantly associated with HL. Approaches to improving HRQoL might be considered to strengthen HL. Additionally, the study identifies desired support mechanisms for COPD patients when de-veloping digital health interventions for this patient group.

In this article, I reconstruct Esposito's analysis, arguing that the proper response to this question should be affirmative. Particular emphasis is laid on what I take to be the two fundamental and controversial premises which support this argument: first, the endogeneity of time-relations involved in financial markets; and second, the revisability of these time-relations.

A key question for continuing research concerns the factors influencing more versus less successful interventions. We show that the quality of past 'stateness' is crucial in understanding contemporary state fragility and statebuilding. Extending beyond previous work, we introduce the concept of past stateness, consider theoretically its relationship to contemporary fragility, and explore this relationship empirically, drawing on cross-national data and newly developed indicators. In line with our expectations, descriptive and inferential analysis shows that lack of experience of two core features of stateness-monopoly of violence and existence of a professional bureaucracy-in the past century predicts chronic fragility today. This association is mainly driven by monopoly of violence rather than existence of a professional bureaucracy. Our analysis sheds new light on the underlying heterogeneity among states today labelled as 'fragile'. From a policy perspective, a key implication is that, in designing interventions, the most relevant experiences are likely to be from other countries with similar stateness legacies, rather than from 'fragile states' more generally. Our analysis does not imply that statebuilding is impossible in contexts with weak stateness legacies, but it does underscore the challenges of this and the importance of setting expectations appropriately.", "keywords": ["monopoly of violence", "professional bureaucracy", "state fragility", "statebuilding", "stateness"]}

The first player, called 'codemaker', chooses a secret code and the second player, called 'codebreaker', tries to break the secret code by making as few guesses as possible, exploiting information that is given by the codemaker after each guess. For variants that allow color repetition, Doerr et al. (2016) showed optimal results. In this paper, we consider the so called Black-Peg variant of Mastermind, where the only information concerning a guess is the number of positions in which the guess coincides with the secret code.

The paper utilizes the Engel-Granger Dynamic OLS (DOLS) estimation technique as well as the Generalized Auto Regressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) approach to model the real exchange rate volatility. In conformity with theoretical considerations, the results indicate that increases in the exchange-rate volatility exert a significant negative effect upon export in Liberia, Nigeria and Sierra Leone. While a positive relationship is established in the case of The Gambia, exchange-rate volatility impact on Ghana and Guinea is insignificant. The results also reveal a positive relationship between terms of trade and export performance for all the countries, indicating that improvement in terms of trade trigger increases in export performance in the WAMZ countries. Income from the rest of the world is found to have a positive effect on export performance in the WAMZ countries. The study also finds that real effective exchange rate has a negative impact on export performance in the case of The Gambia, Ghana and Nigeria, while a positive relationship is established in the case of Guinea and Liberia. However, while a positive relationship is revealed for Sierra Leone in the long run, its impact in the short run is negative. A key lesson arising from this study is that trade policy actions aimed at stabilizing the export market are likely to generate uncertain results, at best, if policymakers in the WAMZ countries ignore the stability as well as the level of the real exchange rate. Thus, if policymakers wish to target exports, policies which will ensure stability of the exchange rate should be of outmost importance.", "keywords": ["Engel-Granger Dynamic OLS", "Exchange rate volatility", "export performance", "GARCH", "WAMZ"]}

An interior Pasinetti equilibrium thus remains the most likely outcome. However, for certain parameter combinations, the system may move onto an explosive trajectory with an ever-rising concentration of wealth and income in the hands of capitalists.

The model builds a micro-foundation for the widely used linear-in-levels estimating equation. Returns to education for parents and productivity of financial investment in children's education determine relative mobility, as measured by the slope, while the intercept depends, among other factors, on the degree of persistence in nonfarm occupations. Unlike many existing studies based on coresident samples, our estimates of intergenerational mobility do not suffer from truncation bias. The sons in rural India faced lower educational mobility compared with the sons in rural China in the 1970s to 1990s. To understand the role of genetic inheritance, Altonji et al. (2005) biprobit sensitivity analysis is combined with the evidence on intergenerational correlation in cognitive ability in economics and behavioral genetics literature. The observed persistence can be due solely to genetic correlations in China, but not in India. Father's nonfarm occupation was complementary to his education in determining a sons' schooling in India, but separable in China. There is evidence of emerging complementarity for the younger cohorts in rural China. Structural change in favor of the nonfarm sector contributed to educational inequality in rural India.

Without any room to absorb revenue losses, in a complex fiscalfederalism arrangement, the government is bound to recurrently see badly needed tax reform, which could lead to a much less distorting tax system, as an unaffordable adventure. The paper is structured in the following way. The next section presents stylized facts that have been underlying a whole decade of unsuccessful tax-reform attempts in Brazil. Section 3 shows how the combination of those facts creates very unfavorable conditions for the approval of the kind of tax reform the country needs. A simple political economy model is developed in section 4. Simulations based on the model are analyzed in sections 5 and 6. Concluding remarks are presented in the last section.", "keywords": ["Brazil", "fiscal dominance", "political economy", "tax reform"]}

India's state-owned utilities are emblematic of this problem, costing the government billions in bailouts while delivering poor electricity reliability. This paper leverages a large-scale reform in India's power sector to show that raising electricity prices—while seemingly counterintuitive—can help propel the sector out of this cycle. Using state-level variation in the implementation of the reforms, I find that manufacturing firms in states where electricity reliability improved increased their consumption of grid electricity by 19%, despite a 3% rise in average prices. Firms also increased worker hours and output, highlighting that previously, unreliable electricity was a binding constraint on production. These results suggest that raising prices, when coupled with improved service quality, is a viable strategy for breaking the cycle of low investment and poor utility performance in the developing world.", "keywords": ["electricity", "India", "manufacturing firms"]}

The relative stability of the New Zealand personal income tax system, in terms of marginal rates, thresholds and the tax base, provides helpful conditions for deriving these estimates. The elasticity of taxable income was estimated to be substantially higher for the highest income groups. Generally it was higher for men than for women. Changes in the timing of income flows for the higher income recipients were found to be an important response to the announcement of a new higher-rate bracket. The marginal welfare costs of personal income taxation were consistent across years, being relatively small for all but the higher tax brackets. For the top marginal rate bracket of 39 per cent, the welfare cost of raising an extra dollar of tax revenue was estimated to be well in excess of a dollar. Furthermore, for the top bracket the marginal tax rate was often found to exceed the revenue-maximising tax rate.", "keywords": ["Elasticity of taxable income", "Income taxation", "Taxable income"]}

Using data from the 2012 Italian Multipurpose survey on households \"Aspects of daily life\", we first derive categories of cultural consumers through Latent Class Analysis and investigate how heterogeneity in cultural profiles is associated with overall life satisfaction and relevant domains (health, leisure, friendship relations, job and economic conditions). The results of our empirical analysis indicate a positive relationship between cultural participation and overall life satisfaction. Still, a more complex picture arises when considering all the statistically significant differences in life and domain satisfaction across cultural consumption patterns. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the role of cultural consumption habits on individual well-being and have implications for culture-led welfare policies.", "keywords": ["cultural activities", "cultural consumption", "cultural participation", "life satisfaction", "subjective well-being"]}

Despite a growing literature on the distributional impact of inflation, there is limited evidence on gender differentials. We innovate by applying distributional measures and a decomposition method adapted from the taxation literature extended with a gender dimension to assess gender differences in inflation regressivity or progressivity, isolate the average inflation rate from the inflation structure effect and identify the drivers of regressivity/progressivity by broad commodity groups (food, heating/electricity, motor fuels, other goods and services). The findings highlight the greater regressive inflation faced by female-headed households compared to men in middle-income countries like Portugal, Poland and Hungary and high-income countries like Ireland. In Germany overall inflation has a neutral impact on women, whereas Finland stands out with a progressive inflation, more pronounced for female-headed households. Consistent across countries, the burden of food and heating/electricity inflation is disproportionately borne by low-income households. Heating/electricity inflation has a larger regressive contribution to overall inflation for female-headed households in all countries, whereas for food this holds only in Poland and Hungary.

Evidence based on corporate sustainability indices — The existing literature on the relationship between corporate sustainability performance and being a domestic or international company doubt on which type of operating has more potential to be corporate sustainable. It might be expected that two types of firms can have different advantages. We take this as an empirical question and bring it to data to find an answer. We created a methodology to compare the corporate sustainability level of different companies. In this methodology, we developed different internationality indices and evaluate the effects of those on corporate sustainability. We used firm level financial variables, time and firm effects for controlling some aspects of firm heterogeneity. We estimate the indices of the internationality using the performance ratings from MSCI KLD 400 Social Index and financial information from Wharton Research Data Services' COMPUSTAT dataset. Our results present empirical evidence to support the hypothesis that being an international firm is increasing the sustainability of the company on average. Furthermore, to better understand the mechanism of this result, we examined the effect of being international separately for the factors (these are named as strengths and concerns in KLD) that increase and decrease the sustainability score of the companies respectively. We found surprisingly that being an international firm increases both strengths and concerns more compared to a domestic firm. This suggests that international companies perform higher standards on the strengths but also face hard time to reduce the concerns due to possibly multiple regulations that they face, or coordination issues in different counties etc.", "keywords": ["Compustat", "Corporate sustainability", "Internationality"]}

Prior studies have established that the reaction of value stocks and glamour stocks to the earnings announcement differs significantly and there is a close relationship between the PEAD and abnormal returns arising due to earning announcement surprises. We have studied the drift patterns of various value and glamour portfolios and tested whether the direction of the earnings announcement abnormal return is opposite to that of earnings surprise in the Indian market. Methodology: We use the statistics of 100 firms listed on the NSE for a sample period of 2014-2018. We use a set of 1130 observations analysed using the expectations formation approach around earnings and evaluate the post earnings announcement drift. We use the Earnings Response Coefficients to find the association between abnormal stock returns and earnings surprises. Scientific aim: The aim of this research is to improve the knowledge of market anomalies in developing markets such as India focusing on the impact of earnings announcement on growth and value stocks. Findings: We find that a negative association of abnormal stock returns with surprise in accounting earnings announcements. The stocks, which are overvalued or undervalued, are properly priced after the earnings announcements. Our results refute the earlier studies evidencing the strong support in favour of market inefficiency in the Indian context, particularly with respect to publicly available earnings information. Conclusions: The Indian stock market tends to be efficient with respect to earnings announcements and therefore does not produce excessive returns. However, a heterogeneity with respect to earnings announcement may exist among the category of stocks depending upon liquidity position.

Evidence from a Multinational Corporation — Many large listed firms offer workers the opportunity to buy shares in the firm at discounted rates through employee stock purchase plans (ESPP). The discounted rate creates a gift exchange, where the firm hopes that workers who accept the gift reciprocate with greater loyalty and effort. But ESPPs diverge from standard gift exchange or efficiency wage models. Employees have to invest some of their own money by purchasing shares at the discounted rate to accept the gift. A sizeable number choose to reject the gift. In addition, the value of the ESPP gift varies with the share price and thus with the performance of the firm and the effort of workers in total. For workers who buy subsidized shares, an ESPP sets up a group incentive pay system analogous to profit sharing, all-employee stock options, or an employment ownership scheme that makes part of workers' compensation depend on company performance. Using data from the UK establishments of a multinational firm that places its ESPP at the heart of its employee compensation system, we compare the workplace behaviour of employees who join the ESPP with that of observationally equivalent workers who do not join the plan. We find that workers who purchase shares at subsidized prices work harder for longer hours and have lower quit and absence rates than workers who do not join the plan, but are no more involved in co-monitoring the performance of fellow employees than non-Plan members. We also find perceptions of peers' Plan participation influences workers' behaviour. ESPP joiners socialise more with colleagues outside work: this greater sense of social identity with colleagues, predicted under some gift exchange models, lowers their costs of work effort and may explain why they are more productive than those who do not join the ESPP. These findings highlight the distinct place of subsidized share purchase schemes in the spectrum of gift exchange and group incentive pay systems.", "keywords": ["effort", "gift exchange"]}

The study proposes that below the TLCI, corruption plays the role of \"sand in the wheels of commerce\" and thus has a negative impact on FDI inflows, but above the TLCI, corruption functions to \"grease the wheels\" and has a positive impact on FDI inflows. The study is based on secondary data collected from the World Bank World Development Indicators. Using a dynamic panel data estimation technique while controlling for other variables, the estimated TLCI in Africa is -0.27 on the control of corruption scale, which ranges from approximately -2.5 (weak) to 2.5 (strong).

The results of my analysis indicate, in line with the expectations of the self-serving bias, that personal experiences with social mobility only influence people's perceptions of societal mobility if the experiences were negative or stagnating. Conversely, those who experienced positive mobility overestimate their personal contribution and, therefore, do not extrapolate from their experience onto perceptions of society at large.

Drawing on a sample of 28 countries over the period 1970-2010 and using the popular and well-known probit estimator, we find strong evidence that foreign aid raises the likelihood of experiencing upward educational mobility in the region, while the probability of downward educational mobility tends to be lower in countries that receive a high level of foreign aid. These effects mainly operate through increased financing for education, an improved education system, and policy, as well as improved education conditions. More interestingly, focusing on the sectoral decomposition of total aid received (i.e., education sector versus the rest of the economy), the study highlights that foreign aid to the education sector tends to increase the likelihood of upward educational mobility, contrary to aid allocated to the rest of the economy.

Thus, relying on one aspect in isolation is less appropriate for measurement purposes and might not lead to positive outcomes. This important finding should concern service scholars and managers because falling profit margins require service firms to move beyond the traditional manufacturing productivity that separates service quality from internal efficiency and consider service productivity as a profitability concept.

Additionally, we assess gender disparities in outcomes, quantify the distributional effects of recent policy changes, and simulate two budgetneutral tax-benefit reforms, focusing on their targeting efficiency and effects on work incentives. Studying the variability of these effects across countries illustrates how better policy design can improve welfare outcomes.", "keywords": ["gender", "inequality", "microsimulation", "poverty", "tax-benefit systems", "work incentives"]}

At the same time, it is highly strategic to ensure macro and microeconomic financial long term balances among public and private sectors. The role of Sustainable Finance, in this context, is absolutely central. On the legislative side, the evolution of international directives, from Non Financial Reporting to Sustainability Reporting, impose to pay attention to new criteria and contents, also in order to distinguish deviant greenwashing phenomena. The paper compares the main frameworks, concerning the multiple and complex dimensions of Sustainability, like the institutional ones (MDG, SDG, BES) and one of the most widespread standard of non financial reporting framework (GRI) adopted by companies. The study aims to identify suitable criteria to allow the development of a simplified integrated analysis model of all targets and indicators established and currently in use, in order to converge effectively on the SDGs, to implement coherent public and enterprise's policies and to produce realistic sustainability reports. The identified suitable criteria are the so called \"ESG\" criteria, increasingly recommended in the context of Sustainable Finance and by Supervisory bodies, as drivers in sustainability analyses, portfolio selection and rating determination. The paper, therefore, shows the results achieved by comparing these frameworks according to the proposed classification based on the individual E-S-G criteria and on their possible combinations (ES-EG-SG-ESG), through multidimensional matrixes of each goal, dimension, target and indicator (n.ê 855) of the examined frameworks. The analysis quantifies the importance of environmental, social and governance drivers and the importance of their combination for each framework considered and also through them altogether. As mentioned in this paper, further analysis by the author leads to develop, according to this ESG simplified classification approach, a new enterprise internal framework, to integrate both sustainability and financial drivers, into Corporates strategic investment decision models and internal capital allocation (tangible and intangible) policies. In this way, the integration of sustainability criteria in all enterprises' decision-making and risk management and control processes, becomes more effective and coherent with the Sustainable Development Goals. Consequently, the complex frameworks analysed, may become more easily comparable and integrated at an application enterprise level.", "keywords": ["Enterprises", "ESG", "GRI", "Integration", "SDGs", "Sustainability Reporting", "Sustainable Development", "Sustainable Finance"]}

Economic decline is concentrated in North Germany, economic ascent in the South. Exploiting plausibly exogenous variation in access to coal, we show that early industrialization turned from an advantage for economic development to a burden after World War II.

With a simple set of group selection models, we show two distinct limitations that prevent recasting in terms of inclusive fitness. The first is a limitation across models. We show that if inclusive fitness is to always give the correct prediction, the definition of relatedness needs to change, continuously, along with changes in the parameters of the model. This results in infinitely many different definitions of relatedness - one for every parameter value - which strips relatedness of its meaning. The second limitation is across time.

In this paper, we present SSMSPC a novel approach for multivariate statistical in-process control (MSPC) based on self-supervised learning. Our motivation for SSMSPC is to leverage the potential of unsupervised representation learning by incorporating self-supervised learning into the general statistical process control (SPC) framework to develop a holistic approach for the detection and localization of anomalous process behavior in discrete manufacturing processes.

In the present model we allow for nominal rigidities due to Taylor- like wage setting as well as price adjustment costs. However, as our analysis illustrates, smoothing marginal costs seems crucial to derive a contract multiplier, wage staggering alone is not sufficient. Without considering a more specific analysis of factor market frictions, we enforce a point made by Erceg (1997) by analyzing the structure of money demand. In particular, we analyze a ?standard? consumption based money demand function by varying the interest rate elasticity of money demand as well as the steady state rate of money holdings.

However, policy debates have so far neglected the crucial fact that families in China largely rely on retired grandparents for childcare. Using novel and high-quality survey data, we demonstrate that intra-family downward labor transfer towards childcare significantly increases young females’ labor force participation rate and their labor income, and such effects do not exist for males. Furthermore, we show that the positive effects from grandparental childcare are higher for better-educated, urban females with younger children. This paper thus reveals a large, hidden cost in the new retirement policy — the reduced feasibility of grandparental support, due to postponed retirements, may crowd out productive labor of young females, — and rationalizes a series of social protection policies to accompany the phase-in of the new retirement scheme.", "keywords": ["female employment", "grandparental childcare", "intergenerational labor division", "minimum retirement age"]}

Understanding the factors influencing tourists’ perceptions of local cuisine quality is crucial. This study explores the development of quality attribute beliefs among tourists unfamiliar with Vanuatu beef. It focuses on credence and experience quality attributes and their evolution through the purchasing and consumption of Vanuatu beef, considering the influence of personal factors on attribute beliefs. Data from 200 tourists in Vanuatu was analysed using factor analysis, means comparison, and multiple linear regression. The results highlight the influence of tourists’ pre-existing beliefs on credence quality attributes, impacting their post-purchase and consumption beliefs. Additionally, personal factors, especially the importance of credence attributes, significantly affect pre- and post-purchase beliefs about experience quality attributes. However, the importance of experience attributes only affects post-purchase beliefs regarding credence attributes. This research provides valuable insights into the formation of tourists’ beliefs about the quality attributes of local cuisine. The findings are particularly significant as tourists’ gastronomic experiences are closely tied to their overall travel satisfaction.

India's manufacturing sector is smaller as a share of GDP than that of East Asian countries, even after controlling for GDP per capita. Hence, its contribution to overall GDP growth is modest.

Standard arguments blame the license-permit raj, the small-scale industrial policy, and the supposedly stringent laws. All these were part of the industrial policy regime instituted after independence, which favored the heavy-machinery subsector. We show that this policy bias negatively affected the development of India's labor-intensive sector, as the country should export with comparative advantage a larger number of these products, given its income per capita. However, India's manufacturing sector is relatively well diversified and sophisticated, given also the country's income per capita.

In fact, when used in collaboration, machines can significantly enhance the complementary strengths of humans. Indeed, because of their immense computing power, machines can perform specific tasks with incredible accuracy. In contrast, human decision-makers (DM) are exible and adaptive but constrained by their limited cognitive capacity. This paper investigates how machine-based predictions may affect the decision process and outcomes of a human DM. We study the impact of these predictions on decision accuracy, the propensity and nature of decision errors as well as the DM's cognitive efforts. To account for both exibility and limited cognitive capacity, we model the human decision-making process in a rational inattention framework. In this setup, the machine provides the DM with accurate but sometimes incomplete information at no cognitive cost. We fully characterize the impact of machine input on the human decision process in this framework. We show that machine input always improves the overall accuracy of human decisions, but may nonetheless increase the propensity of certain types of errors (such as false positives). The machine can also induce the human to exert more cognitive efforts, even though its input is highly accurate. Interestingly, this happens when the DM is most cognitively constrained, for instance, because of time pressure or multitasking. Synthesizing these results, we pinpoint the decision environments in which human-machine collaboration is likely to be most beneficial.", "keywords": ["human-machine collaboration", "rational inattention"]}

Results from a Panel Approach — A considerable degree of business cycle synchronization is key to a successful operating currency union.

But stronger FDI linkages may also have a significant impact on business cycles and co-movement of these cycles between countries and therefore create a potential conflict between policies that promote FDI and the conduct of the common monetary policy. In this paper we empirically analyze the FDI channel in more detail revisiting the main determinants of synchronization.

In the Canadian political system, the provincial and federal governments play an important role in implementing enabling policies for the social economy, and municipalities have a limited capacity to intervene. This context, however, has not precluded the creation of significant relationships between the social economy and the Montreal municipal government, particularly on a sectoral basis. Following adoption in 2013 by the Quebec National Assembly of framework legislation on the social economy, the period 2013-2019 was characterized by an ongoing process of policy co-construction in Montreal, spearheaded by a diversity of actors. The paper highlights the importance of adopting and maintaining an integrated, ecosystemic approach; of establishing relations based on partnerships and not on the subordination of the social economy to a political agenda or to public administrations; and of integrating the social economy into an overall vision of ecological and social transition in an urban setting. Montreal's social economy enterprises contributed to socioeconomic development in key sectors affecting the quality of life, including housing, culture, sports and recreation, and food systems. Major changes during the period included the development of the social economy in emerging sectors, innovations in traditional sectors, an increased contribution from universities and youth, and intersections with emerging issues such as the circular economy and the commons.

In a recent paper (Beine, Docquier and Rapoport, Economic Journal, 2008) we used the Docquier and Marfouk (2006) data set on emigration rates by education level to examine the impact of brain drain migration on gross (pre-migration) human capital formation in developing countries. We found a positive effect of skilled migration prospects on human capital growth in a cross-section of 127 developing countries, with an elasticity of about 5 percent. In this paper we assess the robustness of our results to the use of alternative brain drain measures, definitions of human capital, and functional forms. We find that the results hold using the Beine et al. (2007) alternative brain drain measures controlling for whether migrants acquired their skills in the home or in the host country. We also regress other indicators of human capital investment on skilled migration rates and find a positive effect on youth literacy while the effect on school enrolment depends on the exact specification chosen.", "keywords": ["Brain drain", "brain gain", "migration"]}

This paper's main contribution to the literature concerns the theoretical foundation of MMT. A simple macroeconomic model shows that MMT is indistinguishable from the Keynesian cross model, as well as a neoclassical macroeconomic model, even when taking account of money in the sense of MMT. This result is in stark contrast to the claims of MMT proponents. Accordingly, it is asserted that MMT is a fundamentally new theory of money and monetary economics. However, MMT is admittedly based on the functional finance concept of the 1940s and money is modelled as an accounting identity. In addition, the fundamental connection between government expenditures for goods and services and the steady state equilibrium value of the national income, the so-called fiscal stance, is a well-known result that is not only consistent with MMT. The interpretation of the fiscal stance, in combination with the accounting identity for money, is a major issue because an equilibrium condition should have a certain causal direction of effects. Based on this reading of the equilibrium condition, policy recommendations encompass the fiscal dominance of monetary policy via monetization of public debt, a job guarantee by the state, along with a so-called Green New Deal. According to the results of this paper, these policy recommendations cannot be justified with MMT.", "keywords": ["Keynesian cross", "Modern Monetary Theory", "Monetary policy"]}

However, under certain conditions, the unobserved full effect can be derived from the observed surprise effect. Most importantly, the ex-ante probabilities of different outcomes must be known. We apply this methodology to a real-world example: the European Central Bank's announcement of its third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROIII). The introduction of TLTROIII was highly anticipated, and therefore partially priced in, as market participants feared a \"cliff effect\" with the preceding operations under TLTROII coming due. We estimate the announcement's full effect, focusing on its impact on a set of asset prices, as compared to a baseline wherein TLTROIII would not have been introduced.

For example, in a two-variable model, we consider weak instrument asymptotics of the form Û1 = ¬ Û2 + cÍn where Û1 and Û2 are the parameters in the two reduced-form equations, c is a vector of constants and n is the sample size. We investigate the use of a conditional first-stage F-statistic along the lines of the proposal by Angrist and Pischke (2009) and show that, unless ¬ = 0, the variance in the denominator of their F-statistic needs to be adjusted in order to get a correct asymptotic distribution when testing the hypothesis H0 : Û1 = ¬Û2. We show that a corrected conditional F-statistic is equivalent to the Cragg and Donald (1993) minimum eigenvalue rank test statistic, and is informative about the maximum total relative bias of the 2SLS estimator and the Wald tests size distortions.

Besides economic motives also intrinsic motivations can influence farmers' behaviour. This study identifies farmers' intrinsic drivers to adopt agroforestry based on the Theory of Planned Behaviour. Furthermore, it compares policy instruments which address the intrinsic drivers to promote agroforestry adoption. Specifically, an agent-based simulation model investigates whether the following interventions increase adoption intentions 1) an information campaign to spread awareness of agroforestry benefits to strengthen positive attitudes, 2) informing farmers about social norms to reinforce their perception of subjective norm, and 3) providing trainings to improve farmers' perceived behavioural control. The research is applied to a case study in rural Rwanda. In line with the Theory of Planned Behaviour, a partial least squares structural equation model confirms that attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioural control influence farmers' adoption intention. The simulations demonstrate that all interventions significantly increase farmers' intention to adopt agroforestry, but their effectiveness is rather small. The information campaign targeting attitude causes the strongest increase. The relatively weak effectiveness of the individual interventions can be enhanced by their combined implementation. Policy-makers who aim to raise low agroforestry adoption rates should consider strategies that target intrinsic drivers as alternatives to economic incentives.", "keywords": ["Agroforestry", "Policy Interventions", "Theory of Planned Behaviour"]}

Several studies have examined the causes of the increasing unhappiness which accompanied the transition process, including deteriorating public goods, rising inequality, income volatility, stagnating labor market conditions, and changing norms. Yet, few papers have sought explanations for the life satisfaction differentials between transition and non-transition economies. In this paper, I specifically examine the life satisfaction gap between post-socialist and advanced countries and the role of political institutions in explaining this gap. My results imply that both macroeconomic factors and the rule of law explain the overall life satisfaction differential between the advanced and transition societies. The rule of law had an additional role of reducing the happiness gap in the 1990s and may have even reversed it in the post-crisis years.

The eigenfunction decomposition approach suggested by Griffith (2000, 2003) is the workhorse to identify spatial and non-spatial components. As the significance of the spatial pattern might vary over time, inference is conducted on the base of a spatial SUR model. Shifts of the Beveridge curve will affect its position, and time series estimates on this parameter are obtained. In contrast to findings for the US and the UK, the results provide serious indication that the degree of job mismatch has increased over the last decade. Although the outward shift of the Beveridge curve can be explained by structural factors such as the evolution of long term unemployment, it is also affected by business cycle fluctuations. The role of cyclical factors threatens the stability property of the curve.

The findings reveal, contrary to theoretical predictions, that private sector financial injections (i.e., electronic wage payments), exert an adverse effect on the GEFM; meanwhile, in accordance with theoretical predictions, public sector financial injections (i.e., electronic welfare payments), do positively influence the growth of the GEFM. In addition, compared to their male counterparts, females are found to be 7% more likely to own a formal account, and are 23.4% more likely to save for farming or business entrepreneurship, while also being 18.8% more likely to borrow for entrepreneurial ventures, therefore suggesting a relatively greater growth potential from female entrepreneurship in the global economy.", "keywords": ["entrepreneurial finance", "entrepreneurship", "financial inclusion"]}

The model highlights the importance of whether the EU views trade and labor mobility as substitutes, in line with standard trade theory, or as complements, as suggested by EU statements about inseparable freedoms. In the former case, the UK can attain its preferred mobility with impunity. Mobility and trade restrictions are higher in the latter case. While the EU’s bargaining position hinges on a willingness to constrain trade, the EU does not benefit from strengthen this, say by fueling resentment about Brexit. The sequence of moves is clearly important. Our model implies that the UK moving first is optimal for both parties. This sequence is also in line with the phased approach guiding the negotiations. With uncertainty about preferences, the EU benefits from claiming to have complements preferences, irrespective of its true preferences. Uncertainty harms the UK. Nevertheless, it is worse off moving second, despite the EU’s preferences then being revealed. Also, if the EU has substitute preferences it could gain from committing to complement preference behavior.

The sharing economy, which primarily involves the transformation of traditional market behaviors into collaborative consumption models, that ensure a more efficient and sustainable use of resources, is part of the circular economy and has generated business models that are compatible with it. This article discusses the possibility for the sharing economy to bring about profound changes in consumer behavior towards products and services and to highlight the factors that drive consumers' shift towards the sharing economy. For this purpose we developed and tested a model in which the change in consumer mindset has as the main direct determinants the satisfaction with the services of the sharing economy and the intention to access such products and services. The study uses data collected through a questionnaire, applied to a sample of 320 customers of Uber - a symbol of the sharing economy, and processed using structural equation modelling.

Indeed, skewness preferences might play an even bigger role in dynamic environments because, even if the underlying stochastic process is symmetric, the agent can endogenously create a skewed distribution of returns through the choice of her stopping strategy. Guided by salience theory, we theoretically and experimentally analyze the implications of skewness preferences for optimal stopping problems. We find strong support for all salience-based predictions in a laboratory experiment, and we verify that salience theory coherently explains skewness preferences revealed in static and dynamic decisions. Based on these findings we conclude that the static salience model—unlike (static) cumulative prospect theory—can be reasonably applied to dynamic decision problems. Our results have important implications for common optimal stopping problems such as when to sell an asset, when to stop gambling, when to enter the job market or to retire, and when to stop searching for a house or a spouse.", "keywords": ["prospect theory", "salience theory", "skewness preferences"]}

Agents have equi-cautious HARA utility functions. In addition to a security with state-independent payoffs, agents can trade a collection of assets with dividends following a time-homogeneous Markov process. We make no further assumptions about the distribution of asset dividends, returns, or prices. If the riskless security in the economy is a consol then agents' portfolios exhibit two-fund separation. However, if agents can trade only a one-period bond, this result no longer holds. The underlying intuition is that general equilibrium restrictions lead to interest rate fluctuations that destroy the optimality of two-fund separation in economies with a one-period bond and result in different equilibrium portfolios.", "keywords": ["consol", "dynamically complete markets", "one-period bond"]}

Among other factors, accessibility and environmental impact are important considerations for HSR station location selection. The desirable requirements of these two factors include improved access to, and intermodal integration with, existing transportation facilities and services (like airports, train stations, and bus stops); avoidance of environmentally sensitive areas (such as water bodies, wetlands, and forest) and land with higher right-of-way costs; and accommodation of strategic necessities (for example, proximity to city centers and socioeconomic development hubs). This study quantifies the overall utility of an HSR station by analyzing the extent to which a location satisfies these desirable requirements. For this, suitable utility functions were developed and evaluated. To obtain individual utility scores, appropriate weights were assigned based on relative importance. The overall utility of a location was then estimated as the weighted summation of these utility scores. A GIS-based analytical framework was specifically developed for geo-processing, mapping, and visualization of the geospatial data analysis and result representation. This utility-based quantification and identification process would be useful to planners in assessing an area and determining the most suitable station locations for an HSR project. The proposed model was used to identify the potential station locations along the Mumbai-Ahmedabad HSR corridor in India and to compare the obtained results with the planned locations of the project.", "keywords": ["accessibility", "environmental impact", "utility functions"]}

The analysis focuses on two major research questions: First, how is the timing of first parenthood associated with previous labour market performance? Second, can differences in first birth-risks be related to labour market performance? In other words, to what extent do the fertility decisions of successfully integrated individuals differ from those who are poorly integrated into the labour force? To account for the impact of cross-national differences in institutional settings, I contrast the continental conservative German welfare state with the liberal market economy of the UK. To account for gender-specific differences in opportunity costs, I distinguish between men and women in this analysis. Using longitudinal micro-data from the SOEP and BHPS, I apply a piecewise constant exponential hazard model. The results show a significantly reduced first-birth risk in the case of German men with weak occupational integration, as well as in the case of British and German women with pronounced labour market attachment.

Theme: Sustainable economies in the information economy. Purpose: To share the quality academic papers presented at the International Conference on Business and Management Dynamics (ICBMD) held from 7 to 8 September 2016 at African Pride Crystal Hotel and Spa in Cape Town. As grey literature, the proceedings are the contributions made by researchers at the conference and are considered the written record of the work that was presented to fellow conference delegates. Methodology: The methodology used varies from researcher to researcher but are suitable for the studies conducted. Thus, on the one hand, studies that were subjective in nature used the interpretive paradigm, where the qualitative approach adopted made used of the interview method to collect data. On the other hand, studies that were objectively inclined adopted the positivist philosophy and used survey questionnaires to collect data. However, there were some academic papers which used mixed methodology because of the nature of the study. Whatever methodology used adhered to the ethos of the philosophies underpinning the methodology. Contribution made to scholarship: The articles come from individual researchers and each article in the proceedings is unique. Mostly, there is no general argument leading from one contribution to the next. However, it is interesting to note that in the area of economic performance it was evident that real exchange rate and net foreign direct investment contribute more towards innovations in economic growth. With regard to human capital development, papers presented evidence that there exists a definite need to explore the phenomenon of personal branding as limited scientific academic research has been done within the field of personal branding or on elements of the topic. Thus, the outcome argues that personal branding has an influence on leadership style which in turn impacts on organisational performance and related hygiene factors. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that current methods or strategies for enforcing institutionalisation of knowledge sharing within an organisation have not been successful, and, as such, new strategies are needed to reinforce efforts to nurture and invigorate the institutionalisation of knowledge sharing within an organisation. With regard to technology and big data impact on organisational performance, it was evident that system performance, memory consumption and CPU utilisation can be used as criteria to compare and evaluate big data technologies to improve organisational performance. Most of the articles' contribution reemphasised technology education and training as a means of digitising business and improving effectiveness. Target audience: The target readership is academic researchers and business leaders who require access to the latest developments in the fields of economics, information management, business, education, development studies, social sciences and technology. It is also for policymakers and other stakeholders who need a better understanding of the impact of new developments on existing policies and regulations for their review or amendment.", "keywords": ["Sustainable economies"]}

This study examines public perceptions of wealth deservingness and preferences for taxing the wealth of the rich, focusing on how opinions vary based on the amount, use, and origin of wealth. Drawing on an original vignette experiment conducted in Germany (n=6,018), our results show a consistent pattern: as wealth increases, its perceived deservingness declines, while support for taxation rises. Similarly, spending on luxury items is seen as less deserving than philanthropic or nonprofit investments, leading to greater support for taxing the wealth of luxury spending rich people. However, wealth obtained through inheritance presents a puzzling exception: although it is perceived as the least deserving compared to wealth gained through entrepreneurship or management, this does not translate into a stronger preference for taxing inheritors over managers.

In its absence, measuring the impact of transparency on accountability and corruption for a large number of countries has been difficult, with scholars using more or less adequate proxies. This paper introduces a new measurement of real transparency—the T‐index—using 14 de facto components, based on direct observations of official websites in 129 countries and five de jure components, based on the transparency laws and conventions adopted. The resulting index is a measurement with very good internal and external validity and moderate precision. The paper argues that de facto transparency must be considered alongside de jure (legal) transparency if we are to judge the impact (or lack of) transparency against accountability and corruption, as a large implementation gap exists, in particular in poor countries, between legal commitments and real transparency. The T‐index has significant impact on both perception and objective indicators of corruption, including perceived change in corruption over time as measured by the Global Corruption Barometer. An analysis of outliers shows that high transparency alone is not sufficient to achieve control of corruption, especially in countries with low human development and poor rule of law, although transparency is a robust predictor of corruption with GDP controls.

Pakistan's pace of structural transformation has been amongst the slowest and lowest compared to other countries in Asia.

This allows for the evaluation of the economy-wide impact of exogenous changes in the trade and productivity of critical sectors. The IO framework helps in identifying these key Pakistani sectors by providing backward, forward, and inter-sectoral linkages for each sector. The results of the IO framework show that the sectors with strong backward linkages in Pakistan are \"Food, Beverages and Tobacco\", \"Textiles and Textile Products\", \"Leather and Footwear\", and \"Construction\". Whereas \"Agriculture\", \"Mining and Quarrying\", and \"Wholesale and Commission Trade\" are the sectors with strong forward linkages.

In particular, inflation not only makes money less valuable, but also makes credit more expensive because of delayed settlement. Based on quantitative analysis, the model suggests that the relationship between inflation and credit exhibits an inverse U-shape which is broadly consistent with anecdotal evidence. Compared to an economy without credit, allowing credit as a means of payment has three implications: [1] it lowers money demand at low to moderate inflation rates; [2] it improves society's welfare when the inflation rate exceeds a specific threshold; and [3] it can raise the welfare cost of inflation for some reasonable values of the credit cost parameter.", "keywords": ["Inflation"]}

First of all, we find a significant relationship between EUA returns and those of the other considered variables that is most appropriately modeled by a Gaussian and Student-t copula. These results contradict some earlier studies that report no statistically significant or even negative correlations between returns of emission allowances and other financial variables. Secondly, considering time-varying copulas shows that the estimated copula parameters are not constant over time. We find in particular that the dependence is stronger  during the period of the financial crisis. In a Value-at-Risk (VaR) analysis, finally, we further illustrate the advantages of copula methods.

Using primary panel data from two survey rounds before and during a major drought in Zambia, we show that such extreme weather events can be associated with adverse impacts on individual aspirations. Further exploratory analyses suggest that aspirations towards assets that are particularly vulnerable to droughts are affected most.

The firms choose between tacit collusion and collusion with communication. Communication implies that the firms meet and exchange information about past outputs and is assumed to be the only legal proof of cartel behavior. The antitrust enforcement takes the form of an exogenous probability to detect the meetings, in which case the firms are sued for cartel behavior and pay a fine.

Second, fraud only arises when the fines for fraud are at intermediate levels and some CSR firms do not certify their practices. Third, the presence of fraud comes at a cost for firms by inducing lower equilibrium prices than in settings with honest marketing. Forth, the coexistence of fraud and certification induces differentiation price premia below marginal production costs and certification price premia above marginal certification costs.

With this paper we want to reopen the debate on how citizens can be involved in this process. We try to show how citizen preferences can be included in the process of pollution control through emission trading. We propose an emission trading system where all emission permits are initially allocated to households who are then allowed to sell them in the permit market or to withhold (at least some of) them in order to reduce total pollution. This proposal tries to overcome the fundamental disadvantage of traditional permit systems which neglect consumer preferences by solely distributing emission permits to producers/polluters. In our system the property right to nature is re-allocated to the households who obtain the opportunity of reducing actual emissions according to their personal preferences by withholding a part or all of the emission permits allotted to them. Such a change in environmental policy would mark a return to the traditional principles of consumer sovereignty by involving households (at least partially) in the social abatement decision process instead of excluding them. Another advantage of admitting households to the TEP market as sellers or buyers of permits is that this increases the number of agents in the permit market and thus significantly reduces the possibilities of strategic market manipulations.", "keywords": ["climate policy", "consumer sovereignty", "Environmental policy"]}

Specifically, by instrumenting Chinese import penetration with China's share in other low- and middle-income countries' imports, we first explore whether Chinese import exposure - both direct (e.g. affecting the sector in which the firm itself operates) and indirect (e.g. through input-output linkages along the domestic value chain) - have been associated with firms downsizing in terms of decreasing employment and sales growth and higher probability of exiting the market. Second, we examine whether firms investing in process and product innovation and skills development perform better in response to import competition. Our results indicate that rising Chinese import exposure - not only direct, but also in downstream segments of the domestic value chain - leads to slower sales and employment growth for the entire sample of surviving firms and to higher probability of shutdown for firms not undertaking any spending in capabilities development.

In this environment, the second-price auction yields both higher expected prices and lower expected quantities than the first-price auction.

We design a field experiment and propose a new estimation technique to address these estimation problems including the mechanical problems associated with repeated observations within peer groups noted by Angrist (2014). The field experiment randomly assigns students to one-to-one partnerships in an important gateway STEM course at a large public university. We find no evidence of peer effects from estimates of exogenous peer effect models. We push further and estimate outcome-on-outcome models which sometimes reveal peer effects when exogenous models do not provide good proxies for ability. We find some limited evidence of small, positive outcome-on-outcome peer effects (which would have been missed without our new estimation technique). Standard estimation methods fail to detect peer effects and even return negative estimates in our Monte Carlo simulations because of the downward bias due to mechanical problems. Simulations reveal additional advantages of our technique especially when peer group sizes are fixed. Estimates of non-linear effects, heterogeneous effects, and different measures of peer ability and outcomes reveal mostly null effects but we find some evidence that low-ability peers negatively affect low-ability and medium-ability students. The findings in this setting of long-term, intensive interactions with classroom random assignment and \"throwing everything at it\" provide evidence of, at most, small positive peer effects contrasting with the common finding of large peer effects in previous studies in education.", "keywords": ["field experiment", "peer effects", "STEM"]}

Although we estimate that the income gains from migration are very large, not everyone migrates and many return. Within this group of highly skilled individuals the emigration decision is found to be most strongly associated with preference variables such as risk aversion, patience, and choice of subjects in secondary school, and not strongly linked to either liquidity constraints or to the gain in income to be had from migrating. Likewise, the decision to return is strongly linked to family and lifestyle reasons, rather than to the income opportunities in different countries.

Adjustment strategies of sanction‐torn companies — The literature on sanctions often neglects the role of domestic firms in sender states, although sanctions only have a real economic effect when senders’ firms reduce their activities on the target's market. In contrast, sanctions avoidance and increasing investments in the target country (the observed behaviour of many companies facing the EU sanctions against Russia imposed in 2014) mitigate the impact of these restrictive measures. While sanctions increase the political risk for companies, they also offer economic opportunities—and previous studies could not settle the debate on which factor prevails. By evaluating responses from British, French, German, Italian and Polish enterprises to an online survey distributed in 2017, we analyse at the firm level how sanction-torn companies adjust to new political orders and what drives their strategic decisions. We find evidence that resource dependency induces strategies that challenge sanction policies: in particular, non-fungible assets in the target country incentivise companies to further increase their engagement. These defiance strategies diminish the real economic effect of sanctions and generate a new economic equilibrium, which has negative long-term implications on the choice set of policymakers to further pursue the imposition of sanctions and which even outlasts the lifting of these restrictive measures.", "keywords": ["sanctions avoidance"]}

This paper makes two contributions to that broad literature. First, we show that many of the most frequently used approaches to measuring mobility or inequality of opportunity fit within a general framework which involves, as a first step, a calculation of the extent to which inherited circumstances can predict current incomes. Second, we suggest a new method - within that broad framework - which is sensitive to differences across the entire distributions of groups with different inherited characteristics, rather than just in their means. This feature makes it particularly well-suited to measuring inequality of opportunity, as well as to any inequality decomposition approach that requires going beyond means in assessing between-group differences. We apply this approach to South Africa, arguably the world's most unequal country, and find that almost three-quarters of its current inequality is inherited from predetermined circumstances, with race playing the largest role but parental background also making an important contribution.", "keywords": ["inequality", "mobility", "opportunity", "South Africa"]}

Evidence from German household data — For cutting down greenhouse gas emissions in road transport, core economic measures are relying on the response to increasing fuel prices—i.e., the fuel price elasticity.

These effects were often neglected in the transport-related literature and were only incorporated recently. The results show, however, sometimes contradicting conclusions on influencing parameters such as income, region-type or household size. In this paper, we used a pooled OLS model estimated on a German refuelling diary data set and analysed the impact of various household level characteristics on fuel price elasticities through an analysis of interaction terms and their marginal effects. This analysis provides a cornerstone in this discussion on fuel price elasticities.

All these factors do not allow potential interested parties to trust it. This undermines the possibility of good cooperation between the public and private sectors and has presented a great limit for the Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) diffusion. Several articles in the literature highlight, in general, the numerous advantages generated using the blockchain in different organizations. The adoption of blockchain in the operation of PPPs could be a solution to overcome the limitations encountered in public-private partnerships. The aim of this study is to propose a theoretical framework aimed at connecting two topics (PPPs and Blockchain)-analyzed separately by literature-to highlight how blockchain can correct the limitations inherent to the functioning of traditional PPPs. Methods: The authors applied a qualitative research method to examine the role of blockchain from a PPP perspective. The authors present a conceptual work in which they advance a theoretical framework by integrating and proposing new relationships between constructs and developing logical arguments for these associations. Through a problem-focused approach, besides presenting a solution to overcome the critical issues, the authors also put forward ideas to help fill a gap in the literature to date. Results: The study showed that blockchain can generate a major shift in the function of PPPs. On the one hand, it makes it possible to overcome many limitations that have hindered the development of partnerships, thus making it possible to spread them further, while on the other hand, it has a positive impact on the strategic role of PPPs in achieving sustainable development goals. Conclusions: Blockchain technology is considered very immature, probably because a single underlying standard does not exist and concepts are difficult to master. Based on state-of-the-art standards, blockchain has the potential to be considered a transformative or even disruptive innovation for PPPs.", "keywords": ["blockchain", "PPP", "trust"]}

Workplace ostracism affects employees’ psychological well-being by fostering exhaustion of their emotional, psychological, and material resources, significantly influencing counterproductive work behavior. The present research also addresses the emerging negative workplace behaviors by studying the mediation of transactional and relational psychological contract breaches. The research has adopted a ‘quantitative research design’ followed by a survey approach to collect data from Pakistan’s healthcare sector employees. 420 questionnaires were disbursed among employees, of which 350 were received back, and 332 questionnaires were finalized after data cleaning and screening. Smart-Pls was used to analyze data and assess the association among different variables. Different tests were performed including the descriptive summary, validity (convergent and discriminant), model fitness and path analysis. Results indicated that WOC significantly impacts CWB. RPCB also significantly influences the CWB. TPCB insignificantly effects CWB and WOC significantly influences RPCB and TPCB. Mediation of TPS has been insignificant, whereas the mediation of RPS has resulted as significant. The present research holds considerable theoretical and practical importance as it provides practical insights to the managerial bodies of the healthcare sector in Pakistan to make strategies for vanishing such counterproductive work behaviors of employees that damage the morale and mental peace of other workers.

Results showed workplace ostracism significantly impacted counterproductive behavior. Relational contract breach mediated this relationship, while transactional breach did not. The findings contribute theoretically by linking workplace ostracism to counterproductive behaviors through psychological contract violations. Practically, they suggest reducing ostracism and relational contract breaches to curb counterproductive behaviors in healthcare organizations. Limitations include the cross-sectional design and sampling from one sector in one region. Further research could use experimental, longitudinal approaches and more diverse samples.

For all the promises they hold, and their transformative potential, technological innovations also present challenges, some of which are of a legal nature. With technological innovation still at a formative stage, it is essential to identify and evaluate those challenges, so as to better understand which of their payment-specific applications to encourage (and how), and mitigate the risk of technological innovation destabilising the safety and efficiency of payments. This paper seeks to explore the key legal issues that policy makers may wish to take into account in assessing the merits and risks of digital innovation, with an emphasis on its application to retail payments, and to contribute to an understanding of how technological advances are likely to affect both payment transactions and, no less importantly, the legal relationships between the parties to them. The scope of this paper is limited to an examination of the legal implications of technological innovation for payments associated with consumer transactions, including those entered into online, and settled otherwise than by way of cash. Consequently, this paper will not examine the legal implications of technological innovation for the processing of transactions relating to transferable securities, for financial stability, for the conduct, by central banks, of their monetary policy operations, for the micro-prudential supervision of payment service providers, for competition among established payment service providers and new entrants, and for financial inclusion, issues of great legal and practical significance that merit (and, no doubt, will receive, going forward) specialized attention.", "keywords": ["retail payments"]}

An example of such a risk measure is the expected discounted future dividend payments. In models which take multiple economic factors into account, this problem is high-dimensional. The solutions to such control problems correspond to solutions of deterministic semilinear (degenerate) elliptic partial differential equations. In the present paper we propose a novel deep neural network algorithm for solving such partial differential equations in high dimensions in order to be able to compute the proposed risk measure in a complex high-dimensional economic environment. The method is based on the correspondence of elliptic partial differential equations to backward stochastic differential equations with unbounded random terminal time.

In a quest for business improvement, this worldwide intense competition in industries has stimulated theories and practical frameworks that seek to optimise performance in workplaces. In line with this drive, the present paper proposes an optimisation model which considers technicians' reliability that complements factory information obtained. The information used emerged from technicians' productivity and earned-values using the concept of multi-objective modelling approach. Since technicians are expected to carry out routine and stochastic maintenance work, we consider these workloads as constraints. The influence of training, fatigue and experiential knowledge of technicians on workload management was considered. These workloads were combined with maintenance policy in optimising reliability, productivity and earned-values using the goal programming approach. Practical datasets were utilised in studying the applicability of the proposed model in practice.

In this paper, we apply the newly developed generalised propensity score (GPS) methodology that allows for continuous treatment, that is, different levels of the firms export activities. Using the GPS method and a large panel data set for German manufac-turing firms, we estimate the relationship between a firms export-sales ratio and its labour productivity growth rate.

Banks may charge a high mortgage rate due to increased default rates. We find that the interest rate of non-recourse mortgage decreases with the borrower's surplus from home ownership. Moreover, non-recourse mortgages benefit only borrowers who deem housing property as an investment asset. Hence, the transition to a non-recourse mortgage is detrimental to welfare if the borrower enjoys a large surplus from home ownership.

Nevertheless, conflicts and contradictions always exist between parent and subsidiary enterprises; if they are in different countries, these conflicts can become especially problematic. Internal control systems for subsidiary supervision and management seem to be particularly important when aiming to align subsidiaries' decisions with parent enterprises' strategic intentions, and such systems undoubtedly involve numerous criteria/dimensions. An effective tool is urgently needed to clarify the relevant issues and discern the cause-and-effect relationships among them in these conflicts. Traditional statistical approaches cannot fully explain these situations due to the complexity and invisibility of the criteria/dimensions; thus, the fuzzy rough set theory (FRST), with its superior data exploration ability and impreciseness tolerance, can be considered to adequately address the complexities. Motivated by efficient integrated systems, aggregating multiple dissimilar systems' outputs and converting them into a consensus result can be useful for realizing outstanding performances. Based on this concept, we insert selected criteria/dimensions via FRST into DEMATEL to identify and analyze the dependency and feedback relations among variables of parent/subsidiary gaps and conflicts.

Survey and census data measure attainment and access, while a grade-3 Portuguese test and 2007 SACMEQ tests measure quality.

However, the institutions to whom whistleblowers report-which are in the literature addressed as internal or external recipients of whistleblowing concerns-have been given limited scholarly attention. Research has instead focused on motives, behaviour, and experiences of whistleblowers on the one hand, and whistleblowing legislation on the other. Particularly the role of external agencies, like ombudsmen, anti-corruption agencies, and Inspector General offices, in dealing with whistleblowing concerns has been under-studied. With the aim of starting to fill this research gap, this paper reports the findings of a comparative study of governmental whistleblowing agencies (other than courts) and non-governmental whistleblowing protection organizations (NGOs), as important examples of external recipients of whistleblowing concerns, in 11 countries with whistleblowing legislation. The study aimed to find similarities and differences between these agencies, and to identify challenges and dilemmas that the installation of whistleblowing agencies bring about. Data collection was done by means of 21 interviews with academic experts and high-ranking officials within the selected countries, and in-depth analysis of available (policy) documents and reports. This paper finds that in the studied countries, there is a trend to install governmental whistleblowing agencies that combine various tasks to implement whistleblowing legislation (e.g., advice, psychosocial care, investigation of wrongdoing or retaliation, and prevention of wrongdoing). When such agencies are absent or considered weak, NGOs may step in to fill the need. Whereas most governmental whistleblowing agencies have investigative tasks, in Belgium and in the Netherlands, investigations of wrongdoing and retaliation are done within the same department for the reason that these issues cannot be easily separated. Other agencies have separated these tasks to avoid conflict of interest or because different expertise is claimed to be needed for both. Further research is needed to analyze the effects of each institutional approach, and how to avoid conflict of interest, particularly the risk of partial investigations of wrongdoing. Our study also shows that while not many countries provide government funds for specific psychosocial care for whistleblowers, most governmental whistleblowing agencies do give advice to whistleblowers and invest in the prevention of wrongdoing or training of those who implement whistleblowing legislation. While providing important insights into the role of whistleblowing agencies in 11 countries, this study also develops questions for further research.", "keywords": ["comparative study", "institutions", "whistleblowing"]}

However, households are spending remittances largely on consumer activities; therefore, this situation is labeled as \"short-term\" IG. Using a broader and holistic system-wide perspective suggests that there are both intended (positive/negative externalities) and unforeseen consequences. The unforeseen consequences are the societal changes as well as positive externalities of remittances in Nepal, which have facilitated an increase in access to services. The latter perspective changes the analysis and reverses the priority of policy recommendations, thus providing a cautionary note to policymakers in formulating policy prescriptions.", "keywords": ["inclusive growth", "Nepal", "poverty", "remittances"]}

Design/methodology/approach: The author uses the principal-agent theory to builds multitask principal-agent model which focuses on two cases. One case is that the effort costs of explicit and tacit knowledge sharing are complementary, but another is the effort costs are substitutable. Findings: It was found that when the effort costs of explicit and tacit knowledge sharing are mutually complementary the multitask R&D outsourcing contract can incent tacit knowledge sharing. Moreover, the multitask R&D outsourcing contract can motivate the effort of explicit knowledge sharing to achieve system optimization, but it fails to motivate the effort of tacit knowledge sharing to achieve system optimization. Research limitations/implications: In this paper we only consider that the outsourcing relationship is short-term, so the multitask R&D outsourcing contract is formal. In fact, the outsourcing relationship may be long-term, so the multitask R&D outsourcing contract is informal. In the long-term cooperation the buyer can promise some reward which cannot be verified by court. service providers choose to trust the promise of the buyer first. Once the buyer don't fulfill the promise, they not only lose the trust of service providers in this cooperation, but also lose social trust and are seen as dishonest enterprises. Practical implications: Our study provides a theoretical model for formulating an effective R&D outsourcing contract and promoting the transfer of explicit and tacit knowledge sharing. Originality/value: The paper extends prior literature by designing multitask R&D outsourcing contract to share the tacit knowledge. We not only consider the cost of substitution relationship between tacit knowledge and explicit knowledge, but also considered the cost of complementary relationship.", "keywords": ["knowledge sharing", "principal-agent", "R&D outsourcing"]}

Although barely responsible for worldwide carbon emissions by way of the modest level of their domestic demand, they can nonetheless contribute to the problem because of global demand for their exported commodities. However, the CO2 footprint of SIDS is rarely assessed because of a lack of data about greenhouse gas emissions or national account statistics. Taking the opportunity of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic shock, an environmentally-extended input-output model based on Eurostat data on air emissions is used to disentangle CO2 emissions embodied in domestic production and international trade, and to identify clearly the origin of emissions by industry. Not surprisingly, the consumption-based CO2 footprint of Seychelles is deemed lower (6.79 tonnes of CO2 per inhabitant) than the production-based inventory (9.55 tonnes of CO2 per inhabitant) for this small open economy relying to a large extent on exports of canned tuna and tourism services.

This study builds on previous research by examining the available evidence on obesity, estimating obesity-related medical costs using more representative and reliable data, and estimating obesity-related risk of disability in the Republic of Korea. The obesity rate is higher for males than for females and for the self-employed (including their dependents) than for employed adults (including their dependents) in the Republic of Korea. The obesity rate shows a weak U-shaped pattern in relation to income for employed adults. It has been growing over time, especially among younger adults and adolescents, indicating greater obesity in the future. Obesity (relative to having a BMI <25) is shown to be associated with about 5,000 won (in 2010 won) higher medical costs for male adults and about 77,000 won (in 2010 won) higher medical costs for female adults. Severe obesity (relative to having a BMI <30) increases medical costs far more than obesity for both males and females, indicating higher cost effects for the few who are severely obese. Moreover, obesity is shown to have increased medical costs far more for relatively unhealthy individuals at higher percentiles of medical costs. When these estimated effects of obesity in increasing medical costs were used to estimate obesity-related aggregate medical costs in the Republic of Korea, they were 35.8 billion won (in 2010 won) for males and 306.5 billion won (in 2010 won) for females. Furthermore, obesity is positively associated with disability, indicating another cost of obesity.

The latter are characterized by organizational and institutional dynamics that affect multiple regimes and cannot fully be captured with the niche-regime categories of the multilevel perspective (MLP). This paper is therefore based on recent approaches from evolutionary economic geography (EEG) that focus on how actors at the microlevel use the plasticity of paths to enact change. The transition path and underlying micro-dynamics over more than 30 years in the Augsburg region revealed in an empirical study are visualized in the form of a transition topology. The results show that RTPS are not a determined process which follows a prescribed course of events from the beginning.

Twenty face-to-face semi-structured interviews were conducted with contemporary Omani entrepreneurs, revealing that these Western Entrepreneurship Orientation (EO) models are perceived as potentially threatening the integrity and harmony of local communities. This perception causes partial resistance toward integrating Western dimensions of EO into the indigenous mindset. Hence, this paper strives to, firstly, identify the Omani cultural orientations that directly impact the application of Western dimensions of EO. Secondly, this paper proposes an alternative scenario for entrepreneurship development through strengthening dimensions of EO taking account of and blending with Omani cultural orientations.

As in many respects, the new EU member states among the CEECs are considerably more advanced than the three accession/candidate countries, Bulgaria, Romania and Croatia (in the following candidates for short). The pronounced reduction in their trade deficits, despite weak demand in their major trading partners and a strengthening currency, is a sign of improved competitiveness in the new member states. The candidate countries show less favourable developments with growing imbalances despite sometimes high export growth. While trade balances in goods production might turn to become positive for the new members as this reflect their longer-term comparative advantages the old members are likely to maintain a competitive edge in advanced business services. The strong degree of integration in production is thus reflected in deteriorating services trade balances for the new members on the one hand as well as through the importance of FDI in these countries on the other hand. The recent privatization has certainly put CEECs in a special position with respect to FDI, however their attractiveness as destinations for foreign capital remains undisputed given the numbers. In terms of infrastructure (human capital, telecommunications, etc.), the ease and reliability of doing business, and the like the new members occupy rank four behind the two groups of advanced economies (EU and other OECD) and the first tier of Asian Tigers – the candidate countries rank generally lower, thus having to defend their position more intensively against competition from the second tier of Asian Tigers and emerging market economies such as Turkey and Mexico. The two giant emerging markets China and India still have a long way to go to catch-up in these qualitative indicators. A distinguishing feature of the new members is their strong performance in terms of human capital and business infrastructure, which is yet not totally matched by an equally strong performance in institutions guaranteeing a reliable and sound business environment. A detailed analysis of the manufacturing sector has shown that the NMS have moved rapidly in changing the composition of industrial production and exports in the direction of a strong representation of medium-high tech industries (i.e. industries with a higher technology and know-how content). Unit labour cost comparisons show that the NMS are not particularly competitive in labour-intensive, low skill industries. This is partly due to a gradual loss of cost advantages in these areas and also due to the increasing import pressure from China (and other low cost producers) in European markets. Some of the NMS (such as the Czech Republic and Hungary) have also improved their positions in higher-tech areas (especially electronics, electrical engineering, precision instruments, etc.) which are areas in which Asian catching-up economies are extremely strong (especially in electronics and computing equipment). A range of indicators (on relative productivity developments across industries, trade specialisation indicators, etc.) all reveal a picture of a dynamically changing pattern of industrial and trade specialisation of the NMS within the European division of labour. An analysis of price versus quality competition (a success in the latter was defined as an improvement in the market share of a producer when its relative price has actually increased) revealed that the NMS were particularly successful in improving their position in quality competition in comparison with other catching-up economies. Such improvements took place across all types of industrial groupings (grouped again by technology intensity) but they were particularly strong in the medium-high tech areas of manufactured commodities; in these areas the NMS (more detailed analysis revealed that this was due particularly to the performances of the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia) occupied a real outlier position. The candidate countries showed their usual features of lagging (so far) in these developments. However, a too simplistic view of a 'convergence' process would also be misleading Particularly in the course of the catching-up process (i.e. when NMS have not yet reached the productivity, wage and income levels of the more advanced economies) there is a lot of scope for inter- and intra-sectoral specialisation and differentiation. This characterises regional developments within countries and also cross-country regional developments and can be observed currently both in the European, the Asian and the global context.", "keywords": ["price versus quality competition"]}

Yet what about procedural legitimacy? Analyzing national survey data on China, this study finds that governance procedures affect the legitimacy of subnational levels of governing, if not necessarily that of the national level. Good governance contributes to trust in local leaders, while corruption not only detracts from trust in local and regional leaders, it increases the public's willingness to protest. This reality was not well-incorporated into the core legitimacy-building approach adopted during the Hu-Wen era. Despite low priority and constrained governance reforms, the main legitimation strategy in the Hu-Wen era remained focused on performance-as growth and equity-even as the public valued procedural legitimacy.

On the other hand, anti-corruption measures might also induce criminal clans to go inactive, owing to the higher “entry barriers” to the “business” of influencing politics, which would reduce violence. To determine which of these possible effects is prevalent, we undertake an empirical assessment of the impact of city council dissolution for mafia influence as prescribed by Decree Law 164/1991 in discouraging violence against politicians in the period 2010-2019.

When substituting 'holds' with the recommendation from the previous period, in most cases the estimated bounds for the asymmetry parameter suggest that analysts are more likely to issue a 'false buy' than a 'false sell' recommenda- tion. This is in line with the frequent statement from the analyst recommendations literature, that optimism relative to the consensus is rewarded in analyst recommendations.

The paper's central hypothesis that capital adequacy of the EMU banking sector influenced credit growth and activities in the nonfinancial sector was confirmed; however, not entirely in all respects expected. We proved that, in general, there was a dependency between banks' capital adequacy and loan growth in the euro area for the observed period Q1 1999 until Q1 2022; yet the correlation coefficient of 0.48 shows a middle positive relationship of variables. At the same time, more than 23% of loans' variability might be explained by variability in capital adequacy. All significance tests proved our results valid. Nevertheless, we saw two very different and slightly controversial dynamics in loan growth and capital ratio during the observed period. Therefore, we were forced to separately continue with an analysis for both time frames: the period before the big financial and economic crisis (Q1 1999 - Q4 2008) and the period starting with the big financial and economic crisis (Q1 2009 - Q12022). The linear regression in the pre-crisis period was almost flat. In contrast, a simple linear regression during the crisis showed a relatively high negative correlation at around -0.6. Therefore, the sub-hypothesis that higher capital adequacy resulted in negative credit growth was supported for the crisis period.

A mere combination of ambiguous functionalities without a clear purpose cannot be considered a technology.

Through a literature review of the criteria for defining a technology, this paper finds that blockchain does not meet these requirements. Additionally, existing definitions of blockchain often fail to meet proper criteria or inaccurately describe its functionality.

We argue that a boom-and-bust cycle is initiated by a displacement that lowers the degree of (ex-post) plan coherence (or order) in an economy. Such displacements can be endogenous (e.g. innovations) or exogenous (e.g. policy alteration). A cycle can be triggered if the displacement signals high short-run profit opportunities but agents lack an understanding of the long-run impact of the displacement and cannot form coherent expectations. The application of the framework aims at making sense of recurring financial crises since the break-down of the Bretton Woods System. First, we argue that the newly emerging international financial architecture has made the financial system more elastic. Second, we show how large exogenous displacements such as capital account liberalization inititated boom-and-bust cycles in developing countries.

This article compares the 2014 and 2009 EP elections in two EU founding members with high electoral support for radical left and radical right Euroscepticism—France and the Netherlands. We study publically visible patterns of partisan mobilization in the written news media with semi-automated content analyses. The data indicate that visible party mobilization on EU issues was on average not significantly higher in 2014. While particularly mainstream and especially incumbent parties publically mobilize on European issues during both campaigns, the radical right’s mobilization efforts have become more visible during the 2014 elections. Examining the temporal dynamics within electoral campaigns, we show that the Eurosceptic fringes exhibit significant contagion effects on the mainstream parties, but that the extent of this contagion was surprisingly lower in the 2014 campaign. As a result, the increasing EU politicization between the 2009 and 2014 electoral contests has not resulted in an enhanced and more interactive supply of partisan debate about Europe.", "keywords": ["EP elections", "EU politicization", "Euroscepticism", "partisan mobilization"]}

For this purpose, we used time series for the period 1995-2020, of the cyclically-adjusted primary balance, the output gap, as well as additional indicators - public debt, fiscal rules index and election years. From the signs and magnitude of the correlation and regression coefficients, it results that almost all countries have learned the necessary lessons from the economic / financial crisis, in order to move from a procyclical policy, during 1995-2008, to an countercyclical policy, in 2009-2020.", "keywords": ["discretionary fiscal policy"]}

Thus, the constrained minimization of aggregate relative deprivation constitutes an economics-based rationale for the philosophy-based constrained maximization of the Rawlsian social welfare function.", "keywords": ["Rawlsian social welfare function", "social stress"]}

The issue is: What kind of financial sources could maintain the development of agricultural production? Internal sources such as profit, depreciation capital, and various reserve and insurance funds can not be considered as a key financial base. State financial support of agriculture in Kazakhstan (which plays a significant role in the most developed countries), is episodic in nature, small in size and typically does not reach the recipients. In these circumstances, a potential supplier of financial and investment resources could be a banking system and such non-banking credit institutions as credit cooperatives. Econometric analysis is used to analyze the determinants of credit access. Results suggest that access to subsidized credit has a significant role in determining access to bank credits and investment activity of agricultural enterprises. Major determinants of credit rationing are the size of arable land possessed by the agricultural enterprise and the cost of equipment, expressing an ability of borrower to use them as collateral.", "keywords": ["credit rationing"]}
