This type of program focuses on providing social government services by way of direct cash transfers to poor families that are often conditioned to the use of public education and health services. Despite the apparent short-term success of these CCT programs in the Latin American context, there still is much debate about whether CCT programs are effective in alleviating poverty. This paper analyzes the effectiveness of conditional cash transfer programs as a long-term incentive in the use of public services-health and education-among beneficiary families of PROSPERA-Oportunidades in Mexico. The Average Effect of Treatment on the Treated (ATT) for the time period 2002-2012 is estimated based on data from the Mexican Family Life Survey (MxFLS) using Propensity Score Matching (PSM). The results show that the program's impact on the use of preventive health and education services by poor families cannot be sustained in the long-term, which puts in doubt the effectiveness of this social protection intervention program in combating poverty in Mexico.", "keywords": ["poverty", "social protection"]}

Through a two-stage interview process involving 294 Arab academics, 20 satisfaction categories were identified, with ‘institutional givingness’ emerging as the most significant. Institutional givingness, rooted in Arab culture, reflects the key to satisfaction. It manifests in three forms: tangible, emotional, and cognitive. Three perspectives on satisfaction were highlighted: the role of givingness in organizational dynamics, technology’s influence on satisfaction, and emotional obstacles to givingness. These insights underscore the interaction of cultural, technological, and hierarchical elements in Arab academia. The study contributes in three ways: advocating a ‘power and give’ approach for boosting job satisfaction in Arab contexts; revealing cultural differences in satisfaction determinants, with Arabs placing significant emphasis on givingness; and underscoring the importance of addressing hierarchical, technological, and emotional aspects of givingness. These findings are crucial for policymakers and educational leaders, offering a strategic framework to create a more satisfying academic environment aligned with Arab cultural values and expectations, thereby fostering a more engaged and committed academic workforce.", "keywords": ["technology"]}

The findings underscore the importance of managing debt sustainably and aligning trade policies with growth-enhancing strategies. Additionally, human capital and institutional quality are essential endogenous growth factors that significantly influence economic growth in Sub-Saharan Africa. The study recommends that while trade openness alone may not directly drive economic growth, its benefits can be amplified by complementary strategies such as investing in human capital, technological adoption, and industrial policy.

Methods: We analysed budget data and ARCH documents, and conducted four observation missions in Benin between March 2018 and January 2020. Results are presented in terms of the three classical objectives of public expenditure management. Results: The government of Benin faces important budgeting challenges when it comes to implementing the ARCH social insurance project: (i) the fiscal space is quite limited, there is a limited potential for new taxes and these may not benefit the ARCH funding, hence the need to prioritise fiscal resources without jeopardising other areas; (ii) the purchasing of health services should be more strategic so as to increase allocative efficiency and equity; (iii) the efficiency of the expenditure process needs to be improved, and more autonomy needs to be devoted to the operational level, so as to ensure that health facilities are reimbursed in a timely fashion in order to meet insured people's health costs, in such a way as to avoid jeopardizing the financial equilibrium of these facilities. Conclusion: The important budgeting challenges faced by Benin when it comes to implementing its UHC policy are also faced by many other African countries. It is important to avoid a situation in which the resources dedicated by the government to the social health insurance system are at the expense of a reduction in the financing of preventive and promotional primary healthcare services.", "keywords": ["Benin", "Budgeting", "Public expenditure management", "Universal health coverage"]}

However, with the current decarbonisation strategy based on electrification, the distribution network infrastructure will have to evolve with increasing electricity demand from other sectors and with stronger emphasis on volatility and flexibility in both generation and demand. The ‘fit and forget approach’ to network access is unlikely to be suitable during the energy transition era. In this regard, a key challenge facing electricity distribution grids is how to efficiently integrate new and flexible grid users. In this paper we analyse the concepts of universal versus restricted network access as well as listed pricing versus market-based allocation of network access rights. Differentiating access can increase efficiency and under ideal circumstances, market-based allocations and listed prices can be equivalent. We discuss different dimensions of access and the design of products and market rules for market-based allocation of access to electricity distribution grids. Adequate design serves to balance the benefits of differentiation and market-based allocation with the related complexity, resulting transaction and the negative effects of market power. With restricted connection agreements on the rise and network operators buying back access as flexibility, the insights from this analysis accompany a current trend in electricity distribution grids and inform policy making and regulation.", "keywords": ["Flexibility", "listed pricing"]}

We first evaluate the impact of the Retirement and Re-employment Act (RRA) reform in 2017, which raised the maximum re-employment age from 65 to 67 years for those who were able to claim pension benefits at age 64. We find that the RRA reform reduced the probability of unemployment among people aged 66 years by 5.8 percentage points and increased the probability to continue working in the longest-held job during the lifetime by 11.4 percentage points. Second, we examine the impact of the pension-eligibility age reform of 2018, which raised the pension-eligibility age from 64 to 65 years for those who were protected by the mandatory labor protection and re-employment policy up to the age of 67 years. This rise in the pension-eligibility age increased the probability of full-time employment by 8.2 percentage points and reduced the probability of part-time employment by 5.7 percentage points among people aged 64 years. These two reforms promoted employment among older adults in different ways. Specifically, enhanced employment protection at age 66 increased the older adults' labor supply in the extensive margin, resulting in a welfare improvement for older adults since those who had been underemployed were less likely to be so after the reform. Still, their ineligibility to claim their pension at age 64 lowered their economic well-being because it increased their labor supply in the intensive margin to supplement the delay in pension benefits.", "keywords": ["older adult", "retirement", "Singapore"]}

The comparison to a business as usual simulation shows some economy-wide rebound effects of about 17% of the overall energy savings. The analysis is limited to 2020. Given that an efficiency strategy is a long-term strategy, this puts the results on the rather conservative side. The results clearly show that improved energy efficiency results in a variety of positive effects on the economy and the environment. These range from reduced greenhouse gas emissions to improved competitiveness of firms and budget savings for consumers to economy wide impacts like additional employment and economic growth.

Using policy control economic instruments, as fiscal and monetary instruments, government may manipulate the economy to gain electoral advantage by producing growth and decreasing unemployment before elections. In addition to increased public expenditures, also the production/supply of certain publicly provided goods may score improvements. In Albania, production and supply of electricity (for the time span of our analyzes) was controlled by KESH (Korporata Energjitike Shqiptare - Albanian Energy Corporation) which is a quasi- monopoly in the supply of electricity in Albania, and it is publicly run. Throughout the transition, supply of electricity, due to various technical and economic reasons, has not been stable, and characterized by systematic interruption for households and businesses users, affecting their well-being and performance (electricity is a main source of energy for households, including heating and cooking). Therefore, it seems so that there is an incentive and rationale for the incumbent to use also the provision of electricity to impress the voters before elections, beside of the classical instruments of expenditures.

Our hypothesis is that before elections, electricity consumption may increase above usual levels, followed by a contraction after elections.

Renewable resources and interactive communications may help do design a better urbanization processes. But all that must be done having as goal to construct local communities and not only to reinforce individual power. As the European Union says for/in Horizon 2020 the scope has to build \"Smart Cities\" that are referred not only to technological aspects but they also constituted by an inclusive, social sustainable environment. Flows of energy and flows of communications characterize the contemporaneous city: the immaterial city (Aragona, 1993, 2000). Town planners have to face with this phenomenon but it is not easy because they are for the most, especially in some nation (e.g. Italy), not educated to do that. It requires to manage the networks of services - not visible service and product (some years ago called often \"value added service\") - beside the physical, built, town that means its spatial, economical structure? and the functional one that is changing (partly or totally) because the reasons before said. This philosophy regards also the energy and all the natural elements (water, wind, soil) contributing to increase the quality life. It seems that, for the most, in many countries town planners accept these changes without trying to address them. It seems that the countries where city as common good is less felt (e.g. many of the Mediterranean nations) these changes for bettering wellbeing and social sustainability are not caught or left to the \"free market\" alone? while Sustainable Copenhagen is one representative example of what can be done. All that is very related to the accessibility of information of people, technicians, administrative employees, politicians. Important is the formation of a \"cultured technology\" for avoiding technocratic \"solutions\" (Del Nord, 1991).

However, only a few analyses have gone beyond estimating the aggregate supply response for the sector as whole or the specific case of cash crops. In most cases, data scarcity especially on producer prices has been the main limiting factor. In this paper, we revisit this question focusing on the supply response of main staple food crops in selected Sub Saharan African (SSA) countries. We use an innovative dataset recently developed by FAO's \"Monitoring and Analysing Food and Agricultural Policies\" (MAFAP) programme which provides prices at the producer, wholesale, and border levels for selected value chains. Using dynamic panel techniques, we are able to test how acreage, production and yields respond to price signals and other non-price factors over the recent food price crises (2005-2013).We observe that farmers producing staple food crops react to real price signals, even if with a limited intensity. Moreover, our results suggest that direct price incentives arising from border protection and government intervention in domestic markets and price shocks at the border are more important than macroeconomic policies in influencing farmers' decisions. We also show that omitting marketing costs from the supply response function leads to underestimation of the price elasticity. Conversely, using wholesale instead of farm gate prices as proxy for producer prices leads to overestimation of the price elasticity.", "keywords": ["price incentives", "supply responses"]}

It turns out that if the joint asymptotic distribution is normal, the presented estimators are asymptotically independent for one and only one specific choice of the scale function. If it is non-normal (this holds for example if the estimators for the shape matrix and scale are based on the minimum volume ellipsoid estimator) only the presented scale function leads to asymptotically uncorrelated estimators.

In particular, we focus our attention on a valuation exercise that addresses the estimation of monetary, short period, on-site damages due to high water events on the different business activities located in Venice. On-site damages include both mitigation costs, which refer to all types of financial expenditure undergone to avert physical and material damages caused by flooding, and remediation costs, i.e. costs to be sustained for maintenance and substitution of affected building elements. Hence, the present study can be considered as a pioneering attempt to analytically quantify, from an economic point of view, on-site damages from high water. An integrated dose-response modelling and an expert-based valuation approach have been selected as the most suitable economic valuation methodology to shed light on the on-site damages. The main focus of the work is to assess dose-response relationships, which are able to describe the physical effects of high water on the different on-site damage categories, including inner and front doors maintenance, cleaning of pavements and maintenance of the walls. Bearing in mind such an economic valuation framework, we proceed with the estimation of on-site damages not only for the present high water situation (business as usual) but also extend the valuation exercise to three additional high water scenarios: (1) a climate change scenario; (2) a high water protection scenario; and, (3) a combined climate change and protection scenario. Estimation results show that the welfare loss due to on-site, short-term damages supported by the business activities ranges from 3.41 to 4.73 million Euro per year, respectively for the business as usual and climate change scenarios. Finally, we can conclude that the introduction of a public policy protection mechanism that defends the city of Venice from any flooding above 110 cm above the Punta della Salute Tidal Datum, such as the MOSE, will reduce the on-site damages supported by the business activities up to 2.87 million Euro per year.", "keywords": ["Economic valuation", "Venice"]}

But different firms have different strategies: one is to protect an invention; a second is to protect a technology space; the third is to attack others' technology spaces.

The size and scope of the electricity price forecasting literature has grown significantly in recent years, with the majority of studies focused on short-term (intraday and day-ahead) or long-term (investment decisions) periods. However, the literature for forecasting the period beyond the day-ahead horizon, which is relevant for trading the aforementioned products or for managing assets over several days, is rather scarce.

However, if the data speak against this assumption, sample-failure problems are often cited, but less attention is paid to economic reasons. We consider this phenomenon as a signal of distinctive population characteristics stemming from the inefficiency component, emphasizing its potential impact on evaluating market conditions. Specifically, we argue more generally that “wrong” skewness could indicate a lack of competition in the market. Moreover, endogeneity of model regressors presents another challenge, hindering the identification of causal relationships. To tackle these issues, this paper proposes an instrument-free estimation method based on Gaussian copulas to model the dependence between endogenous regressors and composite errors, while accommodating positively or negatively skewed inefficiency through simultaneous identification. Monte Carlo simulation experiments demonstrate the suitability of our estimator, comparing it with alternative methods. The contributions of this study are twofold. On the one hand, we contribute to the literature on stochastic frontier models by providing a comprehensive method for dealing with “wrong” skewness and endogenous regressors simultaneously. On the other hand, our contribution to an economic understanding of “wrong” skewness expands the comprehension of market behaviors and competition levels. Empirical findings on Vietnamese firm efficiency indicate that endogeneity hinders the detection of “wrong” skewness and suggests a lack of competitive market conditions. The latter underscores the importance of policy interventions to incentivize firms in non-competitive markets.", "keywords": ["Endogenous regressors", "Stochastic frontier"]}

The dominant result in the rather few studies until now is the finding of no  or even a negative  impact on subjective well being following birth of a child. We focus on the impact from having children using two very big panel data sets. The first is the European Community Household Panel (ECHP) with data collected over 8 annual waves from 1994 to 2001 in 15 EU member countries. Observations are available for up to 15 countries with big differences in fertility levels, child care institutions and labour force participation for married women. At the same time, the ECHP data contains a lot of relevant demographic and labour market background variables to be included in the econometric analyses of the SWB impact from children. The second data set is The German Socio Economic Panel (GSOEP). Like the ECHP, the GSOEP data contains many relevant background factors. This presents a unique opportunity to combine the cross country perspective in the ECHP data with the possibility presented by the GSOEP of following the impact from giving birth over a significantly longer period including approximately 11.000 households.", "keywords": ["life events", "panel data", "subjective well-being"]}

A chi-square test may then be performed to compare the proportions of positive outcomes in and outside this interval. However, if the two cutpoints are chosen to maximize the chi-square statistic, referring the obtained chi-square statistic to the standard chi-square distribution is an inappropriate approach.

Stavins (2021) examines the evolution of payments from paper to cards and electronic payments, while Shy (2020) shows the payments landscape across merchant types. This paper combines the cross-sectional analysis across merchants with the aggregate time series study to analyze the evolution of consumer payments by merchant type. Using data from a representative diary survey of US consumers collected annually over the past several years, we examine changes for each merchant type to assess which transactions shifted from paper to electronic payments and from in-person to remote transactions. We find that cash use declined faster than check use, in large part because transactions shifted from in person to remote. While the cash-use share of transactions dropped for almost all merchant types, changes in check use were much more heterogenous across merchants. COVID-19 accelerated the payments evolution away from cash for some merchant types, as their drop in cash payments was much larger during the pandemic than prior to it. Merchants whose transactions are typically conducted in person experienced the largest decline in cash payments during the pandemic. Regression results show that the probability of using either cash or checks declined significantly in 2019 and 2020, even after controlling for merchant types, the dollar value of transactions, and consumers' socio-demographic attributes.", "keywords": ["cards", "cash", "check", "consumer payments", "electronic payments"]}

Randomly reporting posts for violating the rules against hateful conduct increases the likelihood that Twitter removes them. Reporting does not affect the activity on the platform of the posts' authors or their likelihood of reposting hate, but it does increase the activity of those attacked by the posts. These results are consistent with a model in which content moderation is a quality decision for platforms that increases user engagement and hence advertising revenue. The second experiment shows that changing users' perceived content removal does not change their willingness to pause using social media, a measure of consumer surplus. My results imply that content moderation does not necessarily moderate users, but it can marginally increase advertising revenue.

Using a flow analysis (inflow and outflow) of poverty, rather than a stock analysis, we explain why poverty is more appropriately understood as a dynamic, with the majority of people flowing in and out of poverty for short durations. Distinguishing between structural and transitory poverty gives rise to a focus on the identification of multiple constituencies in the wider population including the permanently poor; sometimes poor; and non-poor. External shocks, including economic and environmental shifts, and risks such as ill-health, can affect any individual, household, or population in a non-predictable way, and can lead to loss of livelihood and a descent into poverty for various durations. At any point in time the bottom billion is made up of a blend of both transitory and structural elements with the former reflecting poverty as a risk for a much wider population than is often assumed. Using this analysis, the total stock of poverty potentially entails up to 5.1 billion people who do not have access to comprehensive social protection systems and are therefore vulnerable to spells in poverty. To protect against shared risks and mutual vulnerabilities, this paper argues that global insurance instruments, regulated through domestic institutions, would provide an efficient solution to transitory poverty.

It is based on the conceptualization of the culture of a person as a set of cultural values and attitudes, represented as an n-dimensional tuple in Euclidean space. The culture of a person is formed through social learning and imitation from role-models, which correspond to the chosen 'displayed cultures' of parents ('vertical transmission') and the society at large ('oblique transmission'). Parents might choose a 'displayed culture' that does not coincide with their true culture, since they aim at countervailing negative cultural influences that their children are exposed to in the society at large. Additionally, they can invest into the success that their displayed culture has in the socialization process of their children. We will consider in the present paper an OLG model with two cultural groups, and where in any period, the members of each of the cultural groups have identical culture. We show that if parents have a desire for cultural closeness to their children (e.g. 'imperfect empathy'), then they will always behave culturally more 'radical' relative to the culture of the other cultural group. Furthermore, they will always invest into their socialization success. Nevertheless, these investments are never sufficient to let the distance between the future cultures of the children of both cultural groups be larger or equal than the cultural distance of the parental generation. As a consequence, the cultures of both groups converge to a homogeneous steady state culture, which can be interpreted as a mixture of the two initial cultures.

Since Chinese aid comes with \"no strings attached,\" a popular narrative is that Chinese aid poses a challenge to conditional aid, thus weakening democracy promotion. This study aims to deepen our understanding of how democratic values are shaped by international economic engagement. Drawing on the Latinobarómetro Household Survey, we use an instrumental variable approach to test the effect of Chinese aid on attitudes toward democracy in 18 Latin American countries on the national and regional level. We find that Chinese aid has a non-negative effect on support for democracy. We also find that individuals who have a positive attitude towards China are more likely to value democracy.

The latter rule improves economic outcomes by providing appropriate incentives to the fiscal authority. More importantly, the additional fiscal conditionality can enhance the credibility of the central bank to achieve price stability.

In contrast to prior studies, our design involves high stakes, with respondents determining a real person's monthly earnings, ranging from $500 - $5,700. We find that the non-incentivized survey module yields nearly identical results compared to the incentivized experiment and recovers fairness preferences that are stable over time. Furthermore, we show that most respondents adopt intermediate fairness positions, with fewer exhibiting strictly egalitarian or libertarian preferences.

The model developed in this paper offers a more general method with less restrictive assumptions than earlier analyses of a dual income tax system. To illustrate the results, the model is applied to the Swedish dual income tax system and is contrasted with earlier works, revealing that the METR for new share issues may have been overestimated in earlier calculations. Our model provides a more comprehensive and flexible toolbox for calculating the METR in a dual income tax system with income splitting rules and improves the possibilities to evaluate how changes in the regulatory framework may affect the METR and the neutrality between investment opportunities.

Thus, this study addresses, first of all, the issue of the division of the national gas fuel and electricity market into sections and separating these market segments that are more susceptible to the existence of competition in the trans-border dimension. This division is a model that reflects every internal market that is self-sufficient and distinguished in technical terms which has been established and is functioning within one or more Member States. The suggested structural, subject-related division of the market into sections, a competitive one (with its segments), a balancing one, and a technical one, makes it possible to determine which fragments of the market prevail over merely the technical security of ensuring continuity and quality of electricity supplies at the national level. Public forms of electricity and gas fuel trading take first place. Thus, second, the issues of legal and business conditions for operation in the energy section of the commodity exchange, regulated market, or open tenders for purchase of energy and interdependence between public forms of electricity or fuel gas trading and standards in the common electricity market have become the subject of this study. The advantage of a commodity exchange that establishes transparent conditions for public trading transactions involving these goods and provides pricing information for actors in the market cannot be overestimated. A commodity exchange enhances competition and is instrumental in the reduction of prices for ultimate clients. The completed analysis aims at reviewing public forms of trading as the instruments for achievement of the objectives of the national energy law and a component for a common energy market in the perspective of development of trans-border transmission capabilities. Legal multi-centricity and multi-aspectual nature of the addressed issues form a structure of relations that has affected the selection of the research methodology. Three research methods were adopted as the main principles that, bearing in mind a different context in which they are used, are treated to be complementary. The first one is an interdisciplinary research analysis, taking account of the context of functioning in the EU law environment in the interpretation of the national law provisions and technical sciences (and thus, e.g., laws of physics, properties of energy, technical aspects of functioning of the power industry as a system of interdependent relations of installations and grids) and economic sciences (e.g., a concept of the market, competition, operation of the commodity exchange). References to technical or economic sciences allowed to maintain the clarity of the above considerations and render the addressed issues better in practice. The legal and dogmatic method is an indispensable supplement of the above method; in this method, the process of interpretation of legal regulations is based on the jurisprudence and case law which should be referred, in particular, to the national law; it is made complete by the analysis of the economic practice. The selection of the concept analysis method (a linguistic one) as the third method should be justified by the undertaken attempts to define in a precise manner the content and the scope of meaning of general, generic concepts making references, as a rule, to a broad spectrum of business operations, the application of which in the EU legislation is a feature of this legal order established on the basis of the elements of the continental (established, statute) law and flexible common law.", "keywords": ["commodity exchange"]}

However, Minsky's theory was not one that dealt in moments but rather in systemic, structural changes in the operations of financial institutions. Therefore, the framework for reregulation must start with an understanding of the longer-term systemic changes that took place between the New Deal reforms and their formal repeal under the 1999 Financial Services Modernization Act. This paper attempts to identify some of those changes and their sources. In particular, it notes that the New Deal reforms were eroded by an internal process in which commercial banks that were given a monopoly position in deposit taking sought to remove those protections because unregulated banks were able to provide substitute instruments that were more efficient and unregulated but unavailable to regulated banks, since they involved securities market activities that would eventually be recognized as securitization. Regulators and the courts contributed to this process by progressively ruling that these activities were related to the regulated activities of the commercial banks, allowing them to reclaim securities market activities that had been precluded in the New Deal legislation. The 1999 Act simply made official the de facto repeal of the 1930s protections. Any attempt to provide reregulation of the system will thus require safeguards to ensure that this internal process of deregulation is not repeated.", "keywords": ["financial crisis", "financial regulation", "Reform"]}

The estimation procedure has the advantage that it can be computed by OLS applied to an auxiliary regression where the observed regressors are augmented by cross sectional averages of the dependent variable and the individual specific regressors. It is shown that the proposed correlated common effects (CCE) estimators for the individual-specific regressors (and its pooled counterpart) are asymptotically unbiased as N approaches infinity, both when T (the time-series dimension) is fixed, and when N and T tend to infinity jointly.

One of the famous suspect explanations is a phenomenon called tax avoidance. We develop a holistic theoretical concept of influences on corporate tax planning through a series of 19 in-depth German tax expert interviews. Our findings show that three distinct hurdles in the tax planning process can explain different levels of tax expense across companies. Those three hurdles are which tax planning methods are. available (defined by business context), desirable (given via aims of tax planning), and implementable (determined by tax manager power). A large part of previous research has estimated the influence of firm characteristics, which we define as part of the business context, on the tax expense, while the other influences that we identify have largely been left \"out of the equation\". In order to apply and operationalize the identified three-hurdle concept, we construct five short, real-world company case studies. In these case studies, we show how variation in two key constructs across companies leads to different levels of tax expense. First, companies vary widely in the aggressiveness of their aims of tax planning. Second, tax managers can assume very different levels of power in their organization, determining the ability to implement tax planning methods. In conclusion, we provide generalizable insights into the tax planning process of companies which help to explain the observed variation in tax expenses across firms.", "keywords": ["manager power", "tax avoidance", "tax planning"]}

To achieve this, entrepreneurs must adopt the role of a facilitator and empower their employees to perform at their best. There are numerous factors that influence one's decision to pursue a career in entrepreneurship, such as the beliefs and desires that individuals possess. Entrepreneurs possess diverse self-perceptions, and this plays a crucial role in their motivation to start a new business. Studies on entrepreneurial self-perception examine the elements, such as personal identity and capabilities-particularly the ability to effectively manage company drivers-which ultimately shape one's decision to embark on a new venture. Launching a startup is not merely an act; rather, it represents a substantial reflection of an individual's self-concept and identity. Consequently, an individual's perceived social identity has a substantial influence on their choice to pursue entrepreneurship, as they view the venture as an extension of themselves. Methods: An online interactive learning environment (ILE) designed to assess the performance management capabilities of wanna-be entrepreneurs, in accordance with the formative assessment paradigm, has been developed. Results: The procedures for carrying out the formative (self-) assessment of wanna-be entrepreneurs' performance management capabilities will be detailed.

Due to the lack of empirical research in the topic, the focus of this paper is to establish and explain which factors determine the demand for technological services and how they can contribute to the promotion of greater university-business collaboration in R&D and innovation. To achieve that goal, we applied the PLS-SEM (Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling) method in order to create a theoretical model, which was then verified through the application of the CTA (Confirmatory Tetrad Analysis) with the purpose of evaluating whether the specification of the chosen measurement model based on the theoretical rationale was supported by data.

This study explores the critical intersection of structural transformation and environmental quality within the context of Côte d'Ivoire, as the country navigates its National Development Plan aimed at structural transformation. Specifically, this research explores how structural changes across the agricultural, industrial, and service sectors impact environmental quality in Côte d'Ivoire. Employing a Nonlinear Autoregressive Distributed Lag (NARDL) model, it investigates the asymmetric effects of sectoral contributions to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) on the ecological footprint, distinguishing between positive and negative shocks during the period 1961-2021. The findings reveal that positive changes in the agricultural sector's share reduce the ecological footprint by 0.222% in the long term, with no significant short-term impact. Conversely, a 1% negative shock in the sector results in a 0.391% increase in the ecological footprint in the short term. For the industrial sector, a 1% increase in its share leads to a 0.178% reduction in the ecological footprint over the long term, while negative shocks show no significant impact. The service sector demonstrates a positive environmental outcome, where a 1% increase in value-added reduces the ecological footprint by 0.368% in the long term and by 0.288% in the short term. For policymakers, these results highlight the importance of promoting sustainable practices within the agricultural and industrial sectors to achieve long-term environmental goals in Côte d'Ivoire. These results are critical for the implementation of Côte d'Ivoire's National Development Plan, which emphasizes the important role of agriculture and industry in its economic transformation, while addressing environmental sustainability. This study provides important understanding into the relationship between structural transformation and environmental quality in Côte d'Ivoire. The research reveals how sectoral shifts in the agricultural, industrial, and service sectors influence the country's ecological footprint, with a focus on the asymmetric effects of these shifts on environmental outcomes. The findings show that while the agricultural and industrial sectors can reduce the ecological footprint over the long term, negative short-term impacts can arise from rapid sectoral changes, particularly in agriculture. A growing service sector appears to have positive environmental contributions. These results are particularly relevant for Côte d'Ivoire's policymakers, emphasizing the need to adopt sustainable practices across key sectors to balance economic growth with environmental sustainability.

Mindful consumption involves incorporating acquisitive, repetitive and aspirational behaviours and purchasing decisions that consider the impact on ecosystems and communities. While previous research has identified success factors such as project descriptions, financing goals, social capital and innovation, their influence on crowdfunding success through the lens of mindful consumption could be less determinant.

The study employs fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis on a sample of 210 Kickstarter projects in the environmental category to identify the necessary conditions for crowdfunding success and unravel the complex factors at play between success and mindful consumption. The results are consistent with previous literature finding that integrating monetary-related keywords alone is not enough for crowdfunding success, indicating that the overall understanding of startup success should be revisited to include social capital.

Drawing on a large, regionally representative survey from 2010, we show that in regions where the embrace of liberal values declined most in the early 1990s, support for democratic values remained weakest a generation later. Instrumenting for the change in values in the early 1990s with variables that capture Soviet-era economic distortions, we connect the vulnerability of a region to the market liberalization shock of 1992 to its diminished support for liberal political values in both shorter and longer runs, particularly for the older cohorts who would have experienced the early 1990s as adults.

We speculate that a possible explanation for why the effect of the early 1990s endures in Russia was the amplification of the economic shock by an \"identity shock\" related to Russia's post-imperial loss of status. In support of this hypothesis, we use multiple waves of the Integrated Values Survey (IVS) to show that in Russia, the demand for democratic values declined in the first half of the 1990s relative to other former communist countries, opening a values gap that persisted through at least 2017. Lastly, we draw on a recent survey experiment to show that respondents primed to consider the economic collapse of the early 1990s, and to a lesser extent the dissolution of the Soviet Union, are less likely to embrace democratic values than those in a control group.", "keywords": ["democratic values", "Russia"]}

Evidence from national surveys of household finance — We investigate whether the willingness to take investment risk is a sex-linked trait and link the results to the country's gender equality regime. Our empirical analysis involves household data on financial asset holdings as well as on self-reported risk tolerance for Austria, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain. Of those countries, Italy is by far the country with the greatest degree of gender inequality according to the 2009 Global Gender Gap Report. Two stages of building a portfolio of financial assets are analyzed. For the first-stage decision of whether to invest in risky assets in the first place, gender is found to have no effect in Austria, the Netherlands and Spain but does have an impact in Italy. However, even for Italy, it seems to be irrelevant in the second-stage decision about the share of wealth invested in the risky assets. We infer from these findings that, for countries with a high degree of gender equality, it is inappropriate to base financial advice primarily on gender.", "keywords": ["gender"]}

The relation that loyalty has with the results of organizations has been tested by numerous studies and the search to retain profitable customers has become a maxim in firm management. Tourist destinations have not remained oblivious to this trend. However, the difficulty involved in measuring the loyalty of a tourist destination is a brake on its adoption by those in charge of destination management. The usefulness of measuring loyalty lies in being able to apply strategies which enable improving it, but that also impact on the enhancement of the organization's results. The study of tourists' loyalty to a destination is considered relevant for the literature and from the point of view of the management of the multiple actors involved in the tourist activity. Based on these considerations, this work proposes a synthetic indictor that allows the simple measurement of the tourist's loyalty. To do so, we used as a starting point Best's (2007) customer loyalty index adapted to the case of tourist destinations. We also employed a variable of results - the tourist's overnight stays in the destination - to create a typology of customers according to their levels of loyalty and the number of their overnight stays. The data were obtained from a survey carried out with 2373 tourists of the city of Seville. In accordance with the results attained, the proposal of the synthetic indicator to measure tourist loyalty is viable, as it is a question of a simple index constructed from easily obtainable data. Furthermore, four groups of tourists have been identified, according to their degree of loyalty and profitability, using the number of overnight stays of the tourists in their visit to the destination. The study's main contribution stems from the possibility of simply measuring loyalty and from establishing four profiles of tourists for which marketing strategies of differentiated relations can be put into practice and that contribute to the improvement of the destination's results.", "keywords": ["Destination loyalty", "Tourist destination"]}

In the first, lobbies are assumed to act as 'principals' and the setters of the policy (the candidates in a Downsian electoral competition or the elected policy maker in a citizen- candidate model of electoral competition) are conceived as 'agents'. In the second setting, the proposed policies are solely determined by the lobbies who are assumed to take the dual role of 'principals' in one stage of the public-policy game and 'agents' in its second stage. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate that in the latter setting, the compromising effect of lobbying need not exist. Our reduced-form, two-stage public-policy contest, where two interest groups compete on the approval or rejection of the policy set by a politician, is sufficient to show that the proposed and possibly implemented policy can be more extreme and less efficient than the preferred policies of the interest groups.

Findings: An integration mechanism using weights is developed to rank the parts based on the total priority scores. The ranked list generated by the system helps management to identify about 50 critical parts to manufacture in-house.

An Analysis of Four Regional Economic Communities in Africa. — It is well known that high levels of regional integration enable portfolio risk diversification and capital mobility. While there have been a number of empirical attempts to verify the presence of capital mobility using the Feldstein-Horioka (FH) approach, none of them to the best of our knowledge have explicitly examined capital mobility changes across regional economic groupings rather than individual countries in Africa, and analyzed sub-samples to compare effects of pre-versus post integration. Filling this gap in the literature, this paper analyzes how some major regional economic integration initiatives, such as SACU (South African Customs Union), UEMOA (West African Economic and Monetary Union), COMESA (Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa) and ECOWAS (Economic Community of West African States)) have influenced capital mobility in their member countries. To estimate the investment and savings relationship, we use Pedroni's (2004) fully modified ordinary least squares (FMOLS) panel cointegration method, applying to a sample of 25 African countries for which annual data is available from 1960-2009.

In particular, we allow for threshold effects of aid, considering that aid might become effective after certain threshold values of other growth-determining factors have been achieved. Overall, we find that the result of an insignificant impact of aid on per capita income is robust taking a long-run perspective. Not being able to establish a significant impact of aid on income in the long run does not rule out that in the short to medium run significant positive (or negative) effects of aid can appear and, therefore, a positive short-run contribution of aid is a possible result and no counter-evidence for the findings related to the long run.

We report three main results. First, global shocks have explained about 26 percent of inflation variation in a typical economy. Oil price shocks accounted for only about 4 percent of inflation variation, but they had a statistically significant impact on inflation in three quarters of countries. Second, global shocks have become more important in driving inflation variation over time. The share of inflation variance caused by oil price shocks increased from 4 percent prior to 2000 to roughly 9 percent over the 2001-2022 period. They also accounted for some of the steep runup in inflation between mid-2021 and mid-2022.

One of the most outstanding elements of these frameworks is ensuring access and use without discrimination for those on the net through the principle of net neutrality. This principle has been embodied in domestic and international regulations, including preferential and free trade agreements. Nevertheless, in the context of the COVID-19 crisis, some governments needed to deviate from this principle due to the increased Internet usage for education, health, and teleworking-related purposes. In that context, this paper analyses how the Pacific Alliance economies (Chile, Colombia, Peru, and Mexico) have regulated and managed the net neutrality principle in the COVID-19 context and draws some lessons for Asia Pacific economies. It features case studies, focusing on how the Pacific Alliance instruments and its members have addressed and incorporated the net neutrality principle.

Comparative matrices of how the Member States of the Pacific Alliance have used their existing policy space or modified their regulations concerning the application of the net neutrality principle during the COVID-19 crisis are developed. The findings exposed the critical role of the Internet and net neutrality in development, prompting efforts to ensure equal access and combat technical discriminatory practices.

Results revealed that perceiving more personal control over one’s life was related to subsequently higher late-life well-being, less severe rates of late-life declines, and a later onset of terminal decline. Associations were independent of key predictors of mortality, including age, gender, SES, and disability. These findings suggest that feeling in control may ameliorate steep end-of-life decline in well-being. We also discuss scenarios for when and how processes of goal disengagement and giving up control may become beneficial.", "keywords": ["German Socio-Economic Panel Study", "mortality", "SOEP"]}

The main objectives of this study are to investigate the factors that affect neonatal deaths as well as examine the effect of the Ghana Health Insurance on neonatal deaths in Ghana. Using the most recent round of the Ghana Demographic and Health Survey, the study estimates the probit model with interaction effects to account for the heterogeneity in outcomes. Additionally, the study employs the propensity score matching approach to account for the possible endogeneity in the insurance enrolment decision. Results from the estimations, after controlling for relevant individual and household characteristics suggest that the national health insurance significantly reduces the likelihood of neonatal deaths. Estimates remain consistent even after more robust estimators are employed. Estimates from the interaction between place of residence and health insurance indicate that health insurance beneficiaries who reside in urban areas are at a higher risk of neonatal deaths compared to other women. Access to medical facilities proxied by distance to the nearest health post emerged as an important predictor of neonatal death. The study also suggests significant regional differences in neonatal deaths. We, therefore, conclude that the national health insurance may have the potential to substantially improve the health outcomes of neonates and have policy implications for increasing coverage to more mothers and their neonates, as well as coverage in critical neonatal services and drugs.", "keywords": ["Ghana", "Health insurance", "Neonatal deaths"]}

Employment affects a country's economic development and social stability, and is an urgent issue that every country needs to solve. This study examines the impact of digital innovation on the absorption capacity of manufacturing jobs, using data from listed companies from 2011 to 2021. The mechanism test indicates that digital innovation fosters enterprise employment through three principal avenues: enhanced total factor productivity, alleviation of enterprise financing constraints, and expansion of the market size. A heterogeneity analysis indicates that the impact of digital innovation is more pronounced in low-technology firms, state-owned firms, and technology-intensive firms. Further analysis revealed that the level of enterprise digital innovation positively affects the employment of high-tech and medium-skilled labour, while having no significant impact on low-skilled labour. In addition, the impact of digital innovation on employment in manufacturing enterprises is not a simple linear relationship, but there is a double threshold effect. When the level of digital innovation reaches a certain threshold, the effect of promoting employment becomes more significant. This study enriches the literature on the impact of digital innovation on employment and provides a useful reference for local governments on how to alleviate employment pressures. The paper draws on data from listed companies in China to examine the impact of digital innovation on employment in the manufacturing industry. It combines theoretical insights with empirical evidence, employing the two-way fixed-effect model and the threshold effect model to investigate this relationship.

This is done in two steps. Firstly, the long-term behaviour of interest rates with one-week maturity is investigated by testing for co-breaking and for homogeneity of spreads against the minimum bid rate (MBR, the key policy rate). These tests capture the idea that successful steering of very short-term interest rates is inconsistent with the existence of more than one common trend driving the one-week interest rates and/or with nonstationarity of the spreads among interest rates of the same maturity (or measured against the MBR). Secondly, the impact of several shocks to the spreads (e.g. interest rate expectations, volumes of open market operations, interest rate volatility, policy interventions, and credit risk) is assessed by jointly modelling their behaviour. We show that, after August 2007, euro area commercial banks started paying a premium to participate in the ECB liquidity auctions. This puzzling phenomenon can be understood by the interplay between, on the one hand, adverse selection in the interbank market and, on the other hand, the broad range of collateral accepted by the ECB.

In this paper, the epsilon-based measure model, which combines the merits of radial and non-radial Data Envelopment Analysis, is employed to measure the energy efficiency, and price index method derived from Iceberg Transport Cost model is used to examine the degrees of market segmentation. On the basis, we use the Tobit model to empirically investigate the impact of market segmentation on China's energy efficiency. The results show that although energy efficiency in the eastern region is higher than that in the central and western regions, the energy efficiency gap is narrowing significantly between the eastern and central, but insignificantly between the western and eastern. Although efforts have been made towards a unified national market, the western provinces still have more segmented markets than the eastern still. Econometric analysis indicates that market segmentation is negative to China's energy efficiency significantly. This finding remains robust even if the endogeneity is excluded and the dependent variable is re-measured by the slack-based measure model, but is of a regional heterogeneity. We also find that factor market distortion, enterprises' R&D investment, and industrial agglomeration are three mediation mechanisms through which market segmentation affects energy efficiency. In-depth analysis indicates that there is a Race to the Top competition centering on market segmentation among Chinese local officials in geospatial and economic space, which triggers a long-term inhibition to energy efficiency.", "keywords": ["Energy efficiency", "Factor market", "Market segmentation", "Tobit model"]}

In this paper, we study how individuals diagnosed with HIV reacted to the introduction of HIV medicine in 1995, which dramatically increased their life expectancy. To isolate the incentive effect, we use Danish register data on HIV-infected individuals and compare how outcomes evolved for individuals who were diagnosed before and after the medicine was introduced, but whose health had not yet been affected by their HIV diagnosis. Our results show that increases in the life expectancy of HIV-infected individuals greatly reduced the negative effect of receiving a HIV diagnosis on labor supply and earnings but did not affect important financial decisions, despite a much longer investment horizon. An increased life expectancy also affected marital behavior, where those facing a longer life expectancy where less likely to marry or cohabit after receiving a HIV diagnosis.

Istanbul has been one of the main destinations of internal migration in Turkey, since the beginning of industrialization process in the 1960s. The main motivation for the people who migrate (especially the unskilled) has been traditionally related to employment and emancipation. However, the recent changes of the Turkish economy – and the policy objectives that are attached to it – are transforming Istanbul into a new hub for other types of migration, like high skilled foreign workers from OECD countries and other forms of short-to-medium term mobilities, which overlap and interact with the traditional opportunity-driven migration.

Standard survey questions eliciting ethical evaluations of actions in on-the-job ethical dilemmas are transformed into a series of incentivized coordination games in the first experiment. We use the results of this experiment to identify the actual ethical norms for financial adviser behavior held by key personnel - financial advisers and their corporate leaders - in three settings: a clash of incentives between serving the client and earning commissions, a dilemma about fiduciary responsibility to a client, and a dilemma about whistle-blowing on a peer. We also measure the beliefs of financial advisers about the ethical expectations of their corporate leaders and the beliefs of corporate leaders about financial adviser norms. In addition, we ask financial advisers about their personal normative opinions, matching a common methodology in the literature. We find, first, systematic agreements in the normative evaluations across the corporate hierarchy that are consistent with ex ante expectations, but second, we also find some measurable differences between the normative expectations of corporate leaders about on-the-job behavior and the actual norms shared among financial advisers. When there is a normative mismatch across the hierarchy we are able to distinguish miscommunication from ethical disagreement between leaders and employees. Our subjects also report their job satisfaction and take part in a second incentivized experiment in which it is costly to report private information honestly. A last finding is that a mismatch between advisers' personal ethical opinions and corporate norms - especially those of peers - strongly correlates with job dissatisfaction, and less strongly but significantly with the willingness to be dishonest.", "keywords": ["financial adviser", "financial services", "norms"]}

There is however little or no emphasis so far on actual delivery mechanisms to channel these resources at the sub-national level, particularly to target the poor who are also often the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. It is in this context that microfinance merits a closer look. This paper offers the first empirical assessment of the linkages between microfinance supported activities and adaptation to climate change. Specifically, the lending portfolios of the 22 leading microfinance institutions in two climate vulnerable countries - Bangladesh and Nepal - are analysed to assess the synergies and potential conflicts between microfinance and adaptation. The two countries had also been previously examined as part of an earlier OECD report on the links between macro-level Official Development Assistance and adaptation. This analysis provides a complementary 'bottom-up' perspective on financing for adaptation. Insights from this analysis also have implications for OECD countries. This is because microfinance is also being increasingly tapped to reduce the vulnerability of the poor in domestic OECD contexts as well and may therefore have the potential to contribute to adaptation. The paper identifies areas of opportunity where microfinance could be harnessed to play a greater role in fostering adaptation, as well as its limitations in this context. It also explores the linkage between the top-down macro-financing for adaptation through international financial mechanisms and the bottom-up activities that can be implemented through microfinance.", "keywords": ["Adaptation", "Bangladesh", "Climate Change", "Financing", "Microfinance", "Nepal"]}

Even in 1996 firms faced considerable regulatory difficulties when willing to grant such incentives. In the meantime the legal environment has changed significantly and today even the German Corporate Governance Code encourages firms to grant stock-based long-term incentives. However, examining a hand-collected unique data-set we find that even only 37% of all German Prime Standard firms have used stock-based long-term incentives in 2006. In these firms stock-based long-term incentives account for less that 23% of the overall compensation to members of the management board. Our empirical analysis reveals that in particular large firms with high RnD expenditures, substantial opaqueness and high free-float are likely to grant stock-based long-term incentives. Furthermore, we find that high inside ownership and large blockholders are negatively correlated with the probability of granting stock-based long-term incentives. Finally, we find that an externally hired CEO increases the likelihood of stock-based incentives, in particularly if the chairman of the supervisory board is a former executive of the firm.

Senior entrepreneurs enjoy higher levels of life satisfaction than retirees and senior paid employees. This higher life satisfaction is mainly due to their higher income. Physical and mental health play a crucial role in determining both an individual's occupational status and their overall life satisfaction.

Although there are numerous studies on estate planning, there still needs to be an effort to systematically review the estate planning measurements. The paper aims to systematically review the literature published between 1990 to 2021 and evaluate the measures of estate planning and its methodological qualities. The systematic literature review process was guided by the PRISMA protocol, where the articles were selected based on established databases such as WOS, SCOPUS, and Google Scholar. The final sample of 24 articles was reviewed for the estate planning measurement, and it was found that previous studies examined estate planning as a tool for financial, wealth distribution, and succession planning. The measurements of only 10 studies were found to be sufficiently validated, rendering other studies under review to be inadequate in establishing sound empirical conclusions. This review contributes to assisting future researchers in choosing well-validated measurements of estate planning and adapting them accordingly to each context.", "keywords": ["estate planning", "planning measurement", "systematic literature review"]}

The trend towards outsourcing logistics operations by manufacturers and trade companies makes these providers widely sought and recognized professionals. Motivated by a search for cost efficiency, this orientation is nowadays similar to a need to acquire skills not internally available or difficult to preserve. The construction and execution of innovative value-creating offers for companies are, therefore, at the heart of the PSL strategies. The relationship that the LSP has with its principal is central to the innovation process and determines the nature and type of the implemented innovation. In this regard, the innovation is perceived by the PSL as a means of perpetuating their relationship. An analysis of the LSP / User Logistic Services dyad (producers, distributors) seems interesting to us as it allows for emphasizing the aspects of this relationship from different angles: logistics, contractual as well as the partnership level. The first part of this paper will set up the theoretical foundations of a reflection on the PSL offer, and in particular their current practices in terms of innovation. In the second part, we explain, through an extensive review of the literature, the main theories used to study the relationship between the PSL and its principal.

While centralised bargaining induces tougher selection among heterogeneous producers and thus increases average productivity, firm-level bargaining allows less productive entrants to remain in the market. Centralised bargaining also results in higher average output and profit levels than either decentralised bargaining or a competitive labour market.

Revenue mobilization is often hampered by limited tax compliance, weak institutions, and technical problems with tax collection. One solution to these challenges is person-to-government (P2G) mobile phone payments, adopted in a number of developing countries since the early 2000s. This study assesses the causal effect of P2G adoption on tax revenue using propensity score matching. According to the matching estimates, countries that adopt P2G services experience a 1.2-1.3 percentage point boost in direct tax revenue as a share of GDP. P2G adoption increases revenue from both corporate and personal income taxes, with larger effects on the latter. The results remain robust to matching quality tests and alternative estimation methods, including function control, two-stage least squares, and system generalized method of moments. The average treatment effects are largest among lower-middle-income countries and countries characterized by limited tax compliance and corruption control, and by low levels of urbanization and domestic credit to the private sector. The findings suggest that developing countries, particularly those with poor institutions and low levels of financial inclusion, should promote the adoption and use of mobile money services for tax transactions.", "keywords": ["developing countries", "direct tax revenue", "mobile money", "P2G", "propensity score matching"]}

To answer this question we are confronted from the data with a prevalent non-compliance and exemptions from the minimum wage. We incorporate this observation in a job search model with three main ingredients: (i) search on-the-job; (ii) minimum wages, with potentially imperfect compliance or exemptions; and, (iii) exogenous wage growth on-the-job. We use panel data drawn from the NLSY79, US youth panel starting in 1979, to estimate the parameters of our simple job search model and, in particular, the extent of non-compliance/exemptions to the minimum wage. The model is solved numerically and we use simulated moments to estimate the parameters. The estimated parameters are consistent with the model and they provide a good fit for the observed levels and trends of the main job and wage mobility data. Furthermore, the estimated model indicates that the non-compliance and exemption rate with the federal minimum wage translates into a roughly 10% of jobs paying less than the minimum wage.

Section 1 situates AI within the framework of I4.0 and provides a brief overview of application-pull and technology-push factors inducing a need for changes. Section 2 delves into ways in which an AI system may unexpectedly fail and discusses trends in AI accidents based on available data. Section 3 explains how the growing convergence of information and operational technology make organisations more vulnerable to cyber-physical attacks, ultimately putting workers' safety at risk. Section 4 provides a critical assessment of the various principles put forward to ensure proper human oversight. Section 5 discusses how the implementation of AI systems may influence workers' autonomy and, in this way, compromise workers' safety and health.

Our evidence indicates that macroeconomic and institutional variables are associated with EM performance, determinants of resilience differ during tightening versus easing cycles, and institutions matter more during difficult times.

This paper documents evidence against this widespread perception. In the months following Lehman's collapse, dealers, including proprietary trading desks in investment banks, provided liquidity in response to the large selling by clients. Corporate bond inventory of dealers rose sharply as a result. Although providing liquidity, limits to arbitrage, possibly in the form of limited capital, obstructed the convergence of the basis. We further show that the unwinding of precrisis 'basis trades' by hedge funds is the main driver of the large negative basis. Price drops following Lehman's collapse were concentrated among bonds with available CDS contracts and high activity in basis trades.

Employing a structural vector auto regression (SVAR) model proposed by Blanchard and Quah, the analysis encompasses both external and domestic shocks affecting individual countries. The study employs four variables: world real GDP, domestic real GDP as a proxy for output, the real effective exchange rate, and the inflation rate as a proxy for price level, to estimate the shocks. Subsequent analysis includes ANOVA, impulse response function (IRF), and variance decomposition to discern shock magnitudes, adjustment dynamics, and underlying determinants of variability. Empirical results show that BRICS countries display symmetric responses to external shock, however, with overall different sources of variation in the responses to domestic supply, demand, and monetary shocks. The results of the analysis using the ANOVA test, IRF, and variance decomposition also highlight the nuanced disparities across BRICS countries in terms of demand, and monetary shocks, indicative of differences in transmission mechanisms and policy responses. The study underscores the implication of aligning exchange rate mechanisms and monetary policies in facilitating the convergence of shock levels, thereby fostering economic stability among BRICS countries. This study provides a critical analysis of the feasibility of BRICS countries forming an Optimum Currency Area (OCA) through the application of Structural Vector Auto Regression (SVAR) modeling. By analyzing the correlation and dynamics of both external and domestic macroeconomic shocks, the research highlights significant disparities in how these shocks affect BRICS countries. Despite these differences, the study identifies a strong symmetric response to external shocks. These findings underscore the challenges of aligning exchange rate mechanisms and monetary policies among these diverse economies, yet also reveal the potential for economic stability through coordinated policy responses to symmetric external shocks. This work is pivotal in informing policy decisions on deeper economic integration within the BRICS bloc. It also suggests that with careful policy design, particularly focusing on strengthening economic interdependencies and mitigating asymmetric shock, the BRICS bloc could enhance its economic stability and global influence. Therefore, the study also offers valuable insights into the feasibility of a common currency or enhanced economic integration for emerging economies considering monetary unions in a complex global financial landscape.

The findings from wavelet coherence supports the Schumpeter hypothesis since the findings proves that there is unidirectional causality from financial risk to economic risk in Greece (i) between 1995 and 1998; (ii) between 2003 and 2013; (iii) between 2013 and 2017 at different frequency levels. The findings clearly reveal how financial risk is important predictor for economic risk in Greece over the period of 1990-2018.", "keywords": ["Causality", "Economic risk", "Financial risk", "Greece", "Wavelet coherence"]}

For doing so we use a stylized economic model that differentiates between real-time and flat-rate pricing and is loosely calibrated on German market data. Counter-intuitively, we find that distortions through induced negative prices do not reduce the net consumer surplus of the FiP relative to the CP. Rather, the FiP performs better under all assumptions considered. The reason is that increased use of renewables under the FiP, particularly in periods of negative prices, leads to a reduction of required renewable capacity and respective costs. This effect dominates larger deadweight losses of consumer surplus generated by the FiP compared to the CP. Furthermore, surplus gains experienced by consumers who switch from flat-rate to real-time pricing are markedly higher under the FiP, which might be interpreted as greater incentives to enable such switching. While our findings are primarily of theoretical nature and the full range of implications of negative prices needs to be carefully considered, we hope that our analysis makes policy-makers more considerate of their potential benefits.", "keywords": ["Real-time pricing"]}

Export upgrading entails export diversification (including overall export diversification, as well as diversification at the intensive and at the extensive margins) and export quality improvement. The empirical analysis shows that total AfT flows have a strong positive impact on export upgrading, and that LDCs as compared to Non-LDCs, are the most important beneficiaries of this positive impact. While the impact of FDI inflows on export diversification in host economies is mixed, these flows do exert a strong positive impact on export quality upgrading. Furthermore, the impact of FDI on export diversification is higher in LDCs than in Non-LDCs. Incidentally, AfT and FDI inflows appear substitutes (in an economic theory sense) in achieving export diversification and complementary in their effect on the improvement of export quality in recipient countries, including LDCs. Results obtained on the impact of components of total AfT are inconclusive, as they suggest both complementarity and substitutability with respect to FDI inflows in affecting export upgrading in recipient countries. Overall, empirical results suggest that AfT and FDI inflows are effective in influencing export upgrading in recipient countries. However, the results also highlight the importance of the interplay between these two kinds of capital flows in affecting export development strategies and FDI policies of recipient countries, notably LDCs.

This paper investigates whether financial incentives can overcome this trade-off in the context of an Indian scheme, Devirupak, that seeks to decrease both fertility and the sex ratio at birth. First, I construct a model where the effects of incentives are determined by the strength of son preference, the cost of children, and the cost of sex-selection, relative to the size of incentives. Second, I create a woman-year panel dataset from retrospective birth histories and use variation in the composition of pre-existing children as well as the state and the year of program implementation to estimate its causal effect. Devirupak successfully lowers the number of children by 1 percent, but mainly through a 2 percent decrease in the number of daughters. Faced with a choice between a son and only daughters, couples choose a son despite lower monetary benefits, and thus the sex ratio at birth unintentionally increases. A subsidy worth 10 months of average household consumption expenditure is insufficient to induce parents to give up sons entirely. Instead, Devirupak increases the proportion of one-boy couples by 5 percent.

Therefore, the objective of this paper was to determine the economic impact of treating clients with dementia in outpatient Dementia Service Centres (DSCs) and simulate the cost progression with real clinical and cost data. Methods: To estimate the cost for dementia care, real administrative and clinical data from 1341 clients of the DSCs were used to approximate the total cost of non-pharmaceutical treatment and simulate the cost progression with a discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC) model. The economic simulation model takes severity and progression of dementia into account to display the cost development over a period of up to ten years. Results: Based on the administrative data, the total cost for treating these 1341 clients of the DSCs came to 67,294, 910 EUR in the first year. From these costs, 74% occurred as indirect costs. Within a five-year period, these costs will increase by 7.1-fold (16.2-fold over 10 years). Further, the DTMC shows that the greatest share of the cost increase derives from the sharp increase of people with severe dementia and that the cost of severe dementia prevails the cost in later periods. Conclusion: The DTMC model has shown that the cost increase of dementia care is mostly driven by the indirect cost and the increase of severity of dementia within any given year. The DTMC reveals also that the cost for mild dementia will decrease steadily over the time period of the simulation, whereas the cost for severe dementia increases sharply after running the simulation for 3 years.", "keywords": ["Administrative data", "Dementia", "Discrete-time Markov chain"]}

Comparisons with similar natives reveal that immigrants' experience earnings profiles are flatter on average, although clear differences show up among skill groups. The effect of time spent in the host country is significantly positive for all skill groups and thus partly offsetting the diverging trend in the experience earnings profiles.

Developed Asia produces technology-intensive intermediate goods and capital goods and ships them to the People Republic of China (PRC) and ASEAN for assembly by lower-skilled workers. The finished products are then exported to the US, Japan, Europe, and other countries. In view of ongoing global financial crisis and European debt crisis, the ability of the rest of the world to absorb Asia's exports has decreased. Export production in some Asian countries has also been subsidized by artificially low prices for labor, land, and energy, and by lax enforcement of environmental regulations. Asian economies should thus rebalance away from relying too much on exporting subsidized goods to developed economies. On the supply side, the best way to rebalance growth is to increase productivity in order to raise wage rates and living standards. This can be done by leveraging production networks to graduate to higher value-added, knowledge-intensive activities. On the demand side, producers in the region should turn to Asian consumers as an engine of growth. This can be facilitated by improving connectivity through increased investment in connecting infrastructure such as transport and telecommunications; and by implementing a region-wide FTA. This paper addresses these issues by providing an analytic description of production networks in Asia. It then discusses how developing Asian countries could leverage production networks to facilitate technology transfer to domestic firms and how a regional FTA could bring Asian producers and consumers together. Finally, it considers how infrastructure investment in large and connecting projects could help to rebalance and sustain growth in the region through increased connectivity and reducing trade costs.", "keywords": ["ASEAN", "connectivity", "infrastructure"]}

We can model such information-sharing relations as an information network, and the strategic interactions as a game on the network. When any two agents in the network are connected either directly or indirectly in a large network, empirical modeling using an equilibrium approach can be cumbersome, since the testable implications from an equilibrium generally involve all the players of the game, whereas a researcher's data set may contain only a fraction of these players in practice. This paper develops a tractable empirical model of linear interactions where each agent, after observing part of his neighbors' types, not knowing the full information network, uses best responses that are linear in his and other players' types that he observes, based on simple beliefs about the other players' strategies. We provide conditions on information networks and beliefs such that the best responses take an explicit form with multiple intuitive features. Furthermore, the best responses reveal how local payoff interdependence among agents is translated into local stochastic dependence of their actions, allowing the econometrician to perform asymptotic inference without having to observe all the players in the game or having to know the precise sampling process.", "keywords": ["Strategic interactions"]}

Social health insurance is seen as a mechanism that helps mobilize resources for health, pool risk, and provide more access to health care services for the poor. Hence Ghana implemented the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) to help promote access to health care services for Ghanaians. The study examined the influence of the NHIS on the behavior of health care providers in their treatment of insured and uninsured clients. Methods: The study took place in Bolgatanga (urban) and Builsa (rural) districts in Ghana. Data was collected through exit survey with 200 insured and uninsured clients, 15 in-depth interviews with health care providers and health insurance managers, and 8 focus group discussions with insured and uninsured community members. Results: The NHIS promoted access for insured and mobilized revenue for health care providers. Both insured and uninsured were satisfied with care (survey finding). However, increased utilization of health care services by the insured leading to increased workloads for providers influenced their behavior towards the insured. Most of the  insured perceived and experienced long waiting times, verbal abuse, not being physically examined and discrimination in favor of the affluent and uninsured. The insured attributed their experience to the fact that they were not making immediate payments for services. A core challenge of the NHIS was a delay in reimbursement which affected the operations of health facilities and hence influenced providers' behavior as well. Providers preferred clients who would make instant payments for health care services. Few of the uninsured were utilizing health facilities and visit only in critical conditions. This is due to the increased cost of health care services under the NHIS. Conclusion: The perceived opportunistic behavior of the insured by providers was responsible for the difference in the behavior of providers favoring the uninsured. Besides, the delay in reimbursement also accounted for providers' negative attitude towards the insured. There is urgent need to address these issues in order to promote confidence in the NHIS, as well as its sustainability for the achievement of universal coverage.", "keywords": ["experiences", "Ghana", "insured", "national health insurance", "perceptions", "social health insurance", "uninsured"]}

SAFE relies on national borrowing and follows the model of the SURE (Support to mitigate Unemployment Risks in an Emergency) facility, put in place during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, SAFE's limited scale and dependence on national fiscal capacities mean it falls short of the collective security funding approach advocated by economists. Meanwhile, Germany's decision to reform its constitutional debt brake marks a major departure from its traditional fiscal policies. The reform establishes a permanent 'defence golden rule', exempting military spending from borrowing limits, alongside a €10 trillion infrastructure fund. Although this move does not endanger Germany's fiscal sustainability, it undermines EU-wide fiscal coordination and conflicts with the SGP. This could weaken the European Central Bank's position in future market interventions. Given these challenges, discussions on a new EU fiscal framework are necessary to ensure fiscal flexibility while maintaining debt sustainability.", "keywords": ["security"]}

Attractions are not only limited to identical technology fields but also generate coagglomerations across different technology fields of firms and universities.

We argue how this generalized axiom captures both aversion to ambiguity, and attraction towards certainty for objective lotteries. We show that this axiom, together with other standard ones, is equivalent to to two representations both of which generalize the MaxMin Expected Utility model of Gilboa and Schmeidler (1989). In both, the agent reacts to ambiguity using multiple priors, but does not use expected utility to evaluate objective lotteries. In our first representation, the agent treats objective lotteries as 'ambiguous objects,' and use a set of priors to evaluate them. In the second, equivalent representation, lotteries are evaluated by distorting probabilities as in the Rank-Dependent Utility model, but using the worst from a set of such distortions. Finally, we show how a preference for hedging is not sufficient to guarantee an Ellsberg-like behavior if the agent violate expected utility for objective lotteries. We then provide an axiom that guarantees that this is the case, and find an associated representation in which the agent first maps acts to an objective lottery using the worst of the priors in a set; then evaluates this lottery using the worst distortion from a set of concave Rank-Dependent Utility functionals.", "keywords": ["Allais Paradox", "Ambiguity Aversion", "Hedging", "Multiple Priors"]}

Under an accrual income tax, employer contributions to pension plans represent an addition to wealth that would be taxed at the time they are made. The interest earned on pension contributions also represents an addition to wealth that would be taxed annually. When a worker retires, all applicable taxes would already have been paid on the benefit, and the flow of retirement income received by the worker would not be taxed. Similarly, employer-provided health insurance arguably represents a current benefit that, under the income tax, should be taxed annually as current income. Under a consumption tax, things are different for pensions. The idea of the consumption tax is to tax what an individual takes out of the system. Since pension contributions represent saving, they are not taxed when they are made. Neither is the interest earned on pension contributions taxed under a consumption tax, since it is reinvested and accumulated. Only when the worker retires and starts to draw retirement income are pension contributions taxed. And only the portion of the retirement income that is consumed is taxed if only half is consumed, taxes are paid only on that half. Although pensions fare better under a consumption tax than under an income tax, it is unclear whether health insurance would, too. If health insurance expenditures are considered current consumption (as most economists believe they should be), the same tax that applied to any other consumption would apply to employer contributions to health insurance. On the other hand, one could argue (as in footnote 3) that health insurance is a merit good and medical expenditures are unfortunate, so that both pensions and health insurance should be excluded from the definition of consumption. The existing tax treatment of employee benefits in the U.S. is a hybrid because we nominally have an income tax under which employer contributions to both pensions and health insurance could be taxed as income. But both receive favorable tax treatment pensions are tax-favored in that current pension contributions and interest on previous contributions go untaxed, and health insurance contributions are tax-free. The tax treatment of pensions is consistent with a consumption tax, not an income tax, and the prevailing view among economists is that the tax treatment of health insurance is consistent with neither. Current attempts to move toward a consumption tax have been welcomed by most economists both because most subscribe to the basic claims that are made for the consumption tax increased saving, improved economic growth, and greater efficiency and because the consumption tax promises to bring greater coherence to a system that, despite improvements during the last 15 years, still has some basic inconsistencies. Major concerns with the consumption tax have been raised by many employers, though, who are comfortable with the existing tax treatment of employee benefits and less obsessed than economists with the notion of allocative efficiency or with making the tax system conform to a consistent theory of taxation. Employers especially employers of skilled labor have at least two reasons for wanting to provide employee benefits and accordingly find the favorable tax treatment of benefits attractive (Rosen forthcoming). First, provision of employee benefits may have externalities that enhance the productivity of workers. For example, employers may want to ensure that their workers have good access to health care so that they are more likely to stay healthy. And they may want to provide pension benefits to workers to relieve workers of the burden and worry of planning and providing for retirement. Second, benefits provide a way for employers to create a bond between the firm and the worker. Such a bond and the commitment between the worker and firm that is implied are especially important in firms where workers have (or need to acquire) a significant amount of firm-specific human capital. Employers, who must bear most or all of the cost of investing in firm-specific training, can reap the returns to their investment only if workers remain with the firm over a long period of time. The importance of these two effects has not been quantified convincingly, although there is some evidence that the latter is important (see, for example, the review by Hutchens 1989, or the evidence presented by Topel 1991). But existing evidence suggests that the loss of favorable tax treatment of employee benefits would make it more costly for employers to provide benefits and could indeed lead to social costs in the form of broken job matches that efficiency considerations would suggest should have continued. Section I below briefly discusses the essential features and implications for employee benefits of some of the tax reform proposals that were introduced during the 104th Congress and promise to be considered further in the future. Section II then presents some estimates of how these comprehensive tax reforms would affect (a) the coverage of workers by employer-provided pension and health-insurance plans, (b) employer contributions to pension and health insurance plans, and (c) the shares of compensation received as pensions and health insurance.", "keywords": ["benefits", "employee", "reform", "tax"]}

We find that treated firms-those that must publish a tax strategy report-also significantly increase the volume of tax strategy disclosure in their annual reports but this disclosure contains more boilerplate. The standalone tax strategy reports contain narratives similar to those in the annual reports, are sticky, and their quality is correlated with those of disclosures on gender and human rights. Turning to real behavioral changes, we document no significant effect on tax planning across several proxies and firm characteristics.

As a result, unions do not take account of the fact that (i) households are heterogeneous in their willingness to work, and that (ii) some households might have to work more hours than they would like to. In this paper, we consider two departures from the standard modelling approach. First, we consider a model version in which unions can demand different hours from different households, directly taking household heterogeneity into account. In this case, we show that unions find it optimal to ration hours worked for all households, such that nobody works more than desired. Compared to the standard case in which all households work the same amount by assumption, the response of output, wages and inflation to monetary policy shocks becomes notably less pronounced. This attenuation reflects that hours worked respond differently across the income distribution. The second model version we consider maintains the assumption that all households work the same amount but prohibits unions from requiring any household to work more than it would like to.

Indeed, in order to hit the overnight rate target, the central bank must accommodate the demand for reserves, draining the excess or supplying reserves when the system is short. Thus, the supply of reserves is best characterized as horizontal, at the central bank's target rate. Because reserves pay relatively low rates, or even zero rates (as in the United States), banks try to minimize their holdings. Over time, they continually innovate, as they seek to minimize costs and increase profits. This includes innovations that reduce the quantity of reserves they need to hold (either to satisfy legal requirements, or to meet the needs of check cashing and clearing), and also innovations that allow them to increase the rate of return on equity within regulatory constraints, such as those associated with Basle agreements.

Screening of EOR methods is a multi-criteria decision making process, and the Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) method as a systematic statistical method, can be applied in this regard. In this paper, the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) as one of the methods under the MCDM category was used to screen 65 Iranian oil reservoirs. The screening method was employed for 10 different EOR techniques using a wide range of properties and conditions. The analysis used a database including more than 800 successful EOR projects across the world and for 9 ideal reservoir parameter values. The relative importance of the reservoir parameters was determined based on the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) at nine importance levels. The findings showed that among the considered screening parameters, to determine the best EOR technique, lithology of the reservoir is the most influencing parameter. Additionally, almost 74% of the oil reservoirs under study, as a first priority, were eligible for CO2 injection, either miscible or immiscible. Thermal methods were in the second stage of ranking. The first and second candidate choice for onshore oil reservoirs was immiscible CO2 and hydrocarbon gas injection, respectively. For offshore reservoirs, CO2 injection and steam flooding were the best choices. Also, miscible N2 injection was the least important technique, due to the huge difference of considered reservoir pressure with minimum miscibility pressure (MMP) of N2 injection.

Furthermore, we also find that the largest decrease of top income shares happens between 1935 and the beginning of the 1950s, but not (as in the US and in France) during the war years, but before 1939 and after 1945 suggesting that the Swedish development was more driven by policy than by exogenous shocks.", "keywords": ["Sweden", "Top incomes"]}

The reason is that the magnitudes of the accidents that we study are so big that the total assets of the injurer are not sufficient to pay for all damages. That is, strict liability for the injurer does not supply incentives enough for the liable party to take efficient care. In order to ensure that victims are compensated, in case of an accident, mandatory liability insurance has been introduced. This may have eroded the incentives to take care even further because of the moral hazard problem. Another component of the compensation system is the 1969 Brussels International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil pollution damage, CLC. The purpose of this convention is to improve the situation with the apparent inadequacy of the system to meet the compensation demands from victims. The CLC forces the states which have complied to establish a fund which has the purpose of compensate victims of an oil accident. However, the compensation coming from the fund does not have any effect on the injurer's incentives to take care. Since the amount paid from the fund in reparation will not affect the injurer's profit, there is no link induced between the level of care and the fund. A construction that would create a link between the injurer's welfare and the assets of the fund is to let the injurer own the fund, and hence earn the interest from the funded means, but place strict and unlimited liability on the fund.", "keywords": ["Compensation", "Liability", "Reparation"]}

Imperfectly insured households adjust production decisionscutting input spending and reducing labor hiringaffecting households with whom they trade inputs and labor. Household businesses proximate to shocked households in the supply chain network experience reduced local sales, and those proximate in the labor network experience a lower probability of working locally. As a result, indirectly shocked households earnings and consumption fall. These declines persist over several years because networks are rigid: households appear unable to form new linkages when existing links experience negative shocks. Propagation is a function of access to insurance networks: well-insured households do not cut spending when hit by shocks, leading to minimal propagation. A simple back-of-the-envelope exercise suggests that the total magnitude of indirect effects may be larger than the direct effects and that social (village-level) gains from expanding safety nets such as health insurance may be substantially higher than private (household-level) gains.", "keywords": ["Production networks", "Propagation"]}

It distinguishes between the nine largest metropolitan areas plus the Federal District of Brasília and describes how differences among these areas vary according to income levels and gender. This paper is based on the National Household Sample Survey (PNAD) carried out by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), a source of data hitherto little used for transportation studies in Brazil. PNAD data is not conceived strictly for transport planning but is the only large-scale survey in Brazil with annual information since 1992 on commute time at national and subnational levels (states and metropolitan areas). Five main findings are stressed. First, travel to work trips tend to be 31% longer in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, the two largest metropolitan areas (MAs) in the country, than the in the other MAs. Second, workers in the poorest population segment (1st income decile) spend on average 20% more time on commuting than the wealthiest decile; 19% of the former make home-towork trips longer than 1 hour against only 11% in the wealthiest group. Third, this gap in commute time between rich and poor is spatially contingent; it is large in Belo Horizonte, Curitiba and Federal District but almost nonexistent in Salvador, Recife,Fortaleza and Belem. Fourth, the data reveal worsening conditions for urban transport since 1992 as reflected in longer average commuting times. However, these worsening conditions have been more pronounced in the 1st income decile and especially the 7th-10th deciles. As a result, the overall differences across income groups have actually weakened during the period 1992-2009. Finally, the gender gap in average commutingtimes has been reduced considerably over the period considered with only small gaps remaining in the extreme income groups. The present study highlights that trends in average commute times in emerging economies, such as Brazil, need not follow the same trajectories as in the Global North. It also shows the importance of not focusing on national trends only; this will obscure important differences between urbanregions. From a policy perspective, the paper shows the usefulness of the PNAD data for monitoring urban mobility conditions in Brazilian major MAs. Yearly variations in commuting time can among others be used to assess the effects of mass transport investments on urban transport conditions.", "keywords": ["Brazil", "commute time", "gender", "income", "metropolitan areas"]}

A common approach to accounting for overdispersion is to consider models with some overdispersed distribution as opposed to Poisson models. Zero-inflated, hurdle and compound frequency models are typically applied to insurance data to account for such a feature of the data. However, a natural way to deal with unobserved heterogeneity is to consider mixtures of a simpler models. In this paper, we consider k-finite mixtures of some typical regression models. This approach has interesting features: first, it allows for overdispersion and the zero-inflated model represents a special case, and second, it allows for an elegant interpretation based on the typical clustering application of finite mixture models. k-finite mixture models are applied to a car insurance claim dataset in order to analyse whether the problem of unobserved heterogeneity requires a richer structure for risk classification.

This period is of particular interest as it marks the time during which the bilateral agreement with the EU on the free cross-border movement of workers has been effective. Since different types of workers are likely to be unevenly affected by recent immigration inflows, we follow the structural skill-cell approach as for example employed by Borjas (2003) and Ottaviano and Peri (2008). This paper provides two main contributions. First, we estimate empirically the elasticities of substitution between different types of workers in Switzerland. Our results suggest that natives and immigrants are imperfect substitutes. Regarding different skill levels, the estimates indicate that workers are imperfect substitutes across broad education groups and across different experience groups. Second, the estimated elasticities of substitution are used to simulate the impact on domestic wages using the actual immigration inflows from 2002 to 2008. For the long run, the simulations produce some notable distributional consequences across different types of workers: While previous immigrants incur wage losses (-1.6%), native workers are not negatively affected on average (+0.4%). In the short run, immigration has a negative macroeconomic effect on the average wage, which, however, gradually dies out in the process of capital adjustment.", "keywords": ["Immigration", "Wages"]}

The analysis uses logistic regression to explore the existence of institutional ownership as a substitute for paying cash dividends in companies belonging to different industrial sectors. The results show that companies in the manufacturing sector have a greater propensity to pay dividends compared to those in non-manufacturing sectors.

In this experimental study, we are primarily interested in how emotions influence responder behavior. Our findings are the following. (1) A higher take rate significantly increases the intensity of irritation, contempt, and envy, and significantly decreases the intensity of joy and happiness. Since negative emotions are experienced as painful, there is direct hedonic impact. (2) Irritation and contempt drive punishment behavior.

We find that on average (across countries) global shocks explain about one third of the long-horizon forecast error variance of output growth, and about one fifth of the long run variance of the rate of change of debt-to-GDP. Evidence on the degree of cross-sectional dependence in these variables and their innovations are exploited to identify the global shocks, and priors are used to identify the national shocks within a Bayesian framework. It is found that posterior median debt elasticity with respect to output is much larger when the rise in output is due to a fiscal policy shock, as compared to when the rise in output is due to a positive technology shock. The cross country average of the median debt elasticity is 1.58 when the rise in output is due to a fiscal expansion as compared to 0.75 when the rise in output follows from a favorable output shock.", "keywords": ["debt elasticity"]}

One regulation covered healthcare sector workers, while the second regulation would have covered workers at firms with 100 or more employees. This paper conducts an original mortality risk analysis for these regulations. Mortality risk analysis evaluates the increase or decrease in expected mortality associated with a new policy, such as a rule or regulation, taking into account economic factors like lost income due to regulatory costs. If we accept OSHA's cost and health benefit estimates at face value, we find that the first regulation related to COVID-19 hazards in the healthcare sector reduces risk initially but increases risk over a longer time horizon. We find that the second regulation would reduce risk according to OSHA's main estimates but may not reduce risk after including some ancillary costs and adjusting the agency's prevented hospitalizations estimate based on more reasonable assumptions. Moreover, OSHA's economic analysis for the two regulations in question does not purport to comprehensively evaluate costs; ergo, our mortality risk estimates probably underestimate countervailing mortality risks stemming from these regulations. We review some of OSHA's underlying assumptions that could change the outcomes of our mortality analysis. These estimates demonstrate that OSHA would benefit from more comprehensive consideration of costs in its economic analysis.", "keywords": ["COVID-19", "mortality risk analysis", "OSHA"]}

We document two main findings. Firstly, individual- fixed effect models suggest that low-educated workers in jobs involving a particular set of basic tasks -say, in numeric rather than reading or ICT tasks- obtain 10% of one standard deviation higher scores in the domain of the PIAAC assessment most related to those tasks than in the rest -say, numeracy relative to literacy or problem-solving scores.

We examine determinants of carefully constructed, bilateral measures of new import protection imposed at the extensive margin. New import restrictions on products arise through the temporary trade barriers (TTBs) - antidumping, safeguards, and countervailing duties - that have become some of the most important time-varying trade policies in use. Our approach explicitly addresses changes to the institutional environment facing these emerging economies as they joined the WTO and promised to restrain other trade policies by keeping applied import tariffs below specified maximum levels. After controlling for this phenomenon, bilateral real exchange rate fluctuations, and potential differences across exchange rate regimes, we find general evidence of a counter-cyclical relationship between macroeconomic shocks and new import protection through TTBs. Furthermore, for the subset of major G20 emerging economies, the trade policy responsiveness coinciding with the onset of the WTO in 1995 through 2008 suggests a significant change relative to the pre-WTO period; i.e., import protection through these policy instruments became more countercyclical over time.

Notwithstanding the merits of this discussion, this paper takes the opposite perspective and analyses how market-internal financial regulation itself may anticompetitively influence sporting results. Virtually every regulative financial intervention distorts sporting competition to some extent and creates beneficiaries and losers. Sometimes, the actual winners and losers of financial regulation stand in line with the (legitimate) goals of the regulation like limiting financial imbalances or preventing distortive midseason insolvencies of teams. However, financial regulation may also display unintended side-effects like protecting hitherto successful teams from new challengers, cementing the competitive order, creating foreclosure and entry barriers, or serving vested interests of powerful parties. All of these effects may also be hidden agendas by those who are implementing and enforcing market-internal financial regulation or influencing it. This paper analyses various types of budget caps (including salary caps) with respect to potentially anticompetitive effects. UEFA's so-called Financial Fair Play Regulations are highlighted as an example. Furthermore, the paper discusses allocation schemes of common revenues (like from the collective sale of broadcasting rights) as another area of financial regulation with potentially anticompetitive effects.

Methods: A life-time Markov model was constructed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of azacitidine compared with conventional care regimens. The health states modelled were: myelodysplastic syndrome, acute myeloid leukemia and death. Variables measured included survival rates, progression probabilities and quality of life indicators. Resource use and cost data reflect the Spanish context. The analysis was performed from the Spanish National Health System perspective, discounting both costs (in 2012 euros) and future effects at 3%. The time horizon considered was end-of-life. Results were expressed in cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained and cost per life-year gained and compared with cost-effectiveness thresholds. Results: According to the current use of each conventional care regimens options in Spain, azacitidine resulted in €34,673 per quality-adjusted life-year gained (€28,891 per life-year gained) with an increase of 1.89 in quality-adjusted life-years (2.26 in life-years). Azacitidine was superior to best supportive care and low dose chemotherapy in terms of quality-adjusted life-years gained, 1.82 and 2.03, respectively (life-years 2.16 vs. best supportive care, 2.39 vs. low dose chemotherapy).

The educational levels of parents are considered key factors in explaining children's educational success. Nevertheless, the literature has not reached consensus on the causal effects of parents' education on their child's schooling. This is because both parents' and the child's schooling depend on unobserved heterogeneity. Moreover, the strong positive correlation of the mother's and father's schooling makes it difficult to separate the effects of each parent's schooling, making it unclear how to control spousal schooling in the analysis. Therefore, this paper estimates a set of semi-ordered vectors of both parents' schooling as an application of the nonparametric bounds method with multiple treatments. It thus derives bounds depending on relatively weak semi-monotonicity assumptions on treatment response, selection, and instrumental variables. A combination of these assumptions provides informative bounds on the average treatment effect of both parents' education on their child's schooling. The main results show that the tightest lower bounds suggest the positive causal effects of parents' schooling, but the tightest upper bounds on the effects are lower than the point estimates that rely on the assumptions of an exogenous selection for parents' schooling. These results suggest that simple regressions overestimate the true causal effect of parents' education.", "keywords": ["Intergenerational transmission", "multiple treatments", "nonparametric bounds"]}

Since the 2008 financial crisis, strengthening capital controls has allowed more monetary policy autonomy and exchange rate stability, verifying the Mundell-Fleming trilemma model.

While corruption boosts innovation for domestic firms, we found that the effect is not statistically significant for foreign firms. Our conclusions are of interest to policymakers, as any measure intended to fight corruption should consider its impact on firm performance. As this article shows, such an impact need not be negative. Nevertheless, if mitigating the impact of corruption is still intended, our results indicate that measures promoting foreign direct investment could help achieve this.", "keywords": ["corruption", "firm performance", "foreign firms", "innovation"]}

However, the scientific literature focused on the economic valuation of pollination services has thus far neglected the role of pollination services in seed production. The marketed food output of many crops is not dependent on pollination services, but these crops indirectly depend on pollination services with respect to their seed production. This study proposes a partial equilibrium framework for identifying the value of pollination services. Using Germany as a case study, we find the value of pollination services is about 33% higher when seed production is considered. This increased valuation is driven by two effects: higher seed costs due to high dependence on pollination services, and a higher demand for seeds due to the land expansion needed to mitigate a potential pollinator collapse. This study demonstrates that more sophisticated approaches are needed to estimate the economic value of pollination services more accurately.", "keywords": ["Economic valuation", "Seed production"]}

The primary objectives of this paper were to explore definitions and theoretical frameworks of workplace abuse and also to examine the international legal aspects of such abuse. We employed Tepper's Abusive Supervision Survey Questionnaire to detect manifestations of abusive behavior toward employees in two large organizations, one public and one private, and one smaller national organization in Israel, while expanding its scope beyond its current use in extant legislation and legal literature. Finally, we aimed to offer practical measures to cultivate an organizational culture that encourages employees to overcome the \"trust gap\" and speak up without fear of retribution. As this is an exploratory study, no hypotheses are propounded. Analysis of the data indicated that the incidence of abusive workplace behavior in the respondents' organizations was not high. Women managers exhibited fewer abusive behaviors than men, although the mean differences between men and women were very modest. This might be explained on the basis of the theory of \"ethics of care\", where women, in contrast to men, tend to support cooperation and shared decision-making rather than overly strict supervision. We further found that abusive behavior was more prevalent in the private concern than the public organizations. It is possible that regulation in public organizations contributes to the reduction of abuse in the workplace. In addition, we found that workers reported more cases of abuse than managers but that the mean differences between employees and managers were minor. Men reported more cases of abusive behavior than women, but the differences we found were insignificant. Indeed, the differences found in all the comparisons were insignificant and cannot serve to form conclusions indicating a trend. Nevertheless, we advocate that governments raise awareness of the issue and the desired outcomes while enhancing workers' protection and dignity. To that end, the relevant authorities should employ uniform terminology and promote applicable legislation.", "keywords": ["dignity", "health", "workplace abuse"]}

Evidence using graph theoretic approaches and spatial panel modeling techniques — In the recent past, regional, national and supranational Science, Innovation and Technology (STI) policies have emphasized supporting interactions and networks between organisations of the innovation system. The policy instrument of the EU in this context are the European Framework Programmes (FPs) that support pre-competitive R&D projects, creating a pan-European network of actors performing joint R&D. In this study, we focus on the embeddedness of European regions in this network. By embeddedness we refer to the notion of centrality in the sense of the Social Network Analysis (SNA) literature. In network theory, vertices that have a more prominent and central network position will more likely benefit from network advantages than actors that have a more distant, peripheral position in the network. A higher network embeddedness of a region, i.e. of organisations located in that region, may increase information and knowledge access in the network, and, thus, create a competitive advantage when it comes to the formation of new collaborations and alliances. The objective of the study is to explain why some regions are able to obtain a better network embeddedness in the European network of R&D cooperation than other regions. For this reason we aim to identify determinants that influence a region's embededdness, involving region-internal factors, such as regional characteristics on their innovation capability, their economic structure and technological specialisation, as well as region-external factors considering the influence of these variables in the neighbourhood of a specific region, referred to as spatial spillovers. To address this question we employ spatial panel modelling techniques, explicitly taking into account the time dimension in our data and the influence of spillovers by specifying a panel spatial durbin error model (SDEM). The dependent variable is the regions' centrality in the FP network for the years 1998-2006, using a sample of 241 NUTS-regions of the EU-25 member states. We aggregate individual FP cooperations to the regional level leading to a network where the nodes are represented by regions and the edges by cross-region collaboration intensities. Using these matrices we calculate a region's centrality relying on two different centrality concepts, namely betweeness- and eigenvector centrality. The independent variables involve regional characteristics related to a region's knowledge production capacity and a region's general economic structure. The results will significantly enrich our understanding of the relationship between a regions network embededdness and its internal and external characteristics.", "keywords": ["network embeddedness", "R&D cooperation"]}

In contrast to earlier studies we are able to capture both entry and exit effects. The empirical analysis makes use of a Swedish welfare reform in which the city districts in Stockholm gradually implemented mandatory activation programs for individuals on welfare. The reform is well suited for investigating effects of such programs for several reasons. First, the reform was not combined with any other policy instruments, like time limits or tax credits, making sure that we will capture effects of mandatory activation policies and nothing else. Second, the reform was initiated at different points of time in different city districts, which ease identification. Third, using data from city districts within a single local labor market we can control for confounding macro economic shocks. Overall, we find that mandatory activation of welfare receivers reduce overall welfare participation and increases employment. We also find that mandatory activation programs appear to work best for young people and for people born in non-Western countries.

This paper empirically examines the effect of being only-child parents on the language ability of their children. The results show that children whose parents are both only children have significantly lower language skills. We further examine urban and rural children respectively, and find that the lower language ability is mainly driven by rural children as they are more constrained by their family socio-economic background. Three channels have been identified to explore the relationship between only-child parents and the lower language ability of their children: intergenerational cognitive transmission; parental engagement in the school life of their children; children's social relationship.

This requires a shift from oil, gas and coal to agricultural, forestry and marine raw materials and will affect the global processing chains for energy, fuels and chemicals. However, the land required for the production of raw materials is competing with the production of food and animal feed. In addition, future land use must better take into account planetary boundaries and the preservation of ecosystem services. In order to achieve economic, ecological and societal sustainability, the necessary measures must therefore be geared towards the UN's sustainability goals. Against this background, the future bioeconomy will have to concentrate on the food, chemical and heavy fuel sectors. Important sub-areas are alternative animal protein for nutrition, feedstock efficiency in the processing of bio-based raw materials, and the expansion of the raw materials spectrum. This requires enormous investment in industrial facilities, the integration of newly emerging value chains and the necessary infrastructure. The annual global investment requirements for renewable energy, bio-based chemicals and fuels, and ecosystem services is estimated at USD 1-2 trillion over the next three decades, equivalent to about 1.3-2.6% of global GDP.

In contrast, we found that humanization treatment has a positive indirect effect on attitudes through empathic concern. At the same time, it also has a direct negative effect on attitudes.

Within Brazil, Indonesia, and Mexico, the effects of different sectoral growth patterns are context dependent, but differences in sectoral growth effects on employment and wages are substantially reduced in states or provinces with higher measured labor mobility. Consistent with this, aggregate employment and wage effects of growth by sector are close to uniform when examined over longer time horizons, after labor has an opportunity to adjust across sectors.

Migrants are particularly at risk of being overqualified in their employment; however, this phenomenon cannot be fully explained by differences in human capital or socio-economic characteristics.

We estimate logistic regression models and find that social capital influences the adequacy of migrants' jobs: We show that migrants are at a greater risk of overqualification if they use only informal job search strategies such as relying on friends or family members. Moreover, we find that homophilous migrant networks and jobs in employment niches are risk factors for overqualification.

Third, by formalizing the relationship between fuel efficiency and carbon intensity, we assess the impact of changes in the input mix and in technological availability on CO2 emissions in the electricity sector. Results show that input mix, capacity utilization and new investment in capacity play a significant role in increasing energy efficiency.

Given the link between increased efficiency and lower CO2 emissions, we conclude that technological change has a negative and significant effect on carbon intensity, while the changing input mix affects CO2 intensity both through an increase in efficiency as well as by lowering the input-weighted emission factor.", "keywords": ["Carbon Intensity", "Energy Efficiency", "Fossil Fuel Electricity Generation", "Technological Change"]}

This choice presents a severe challenge to researchers attempting to learn the impacts of migration, since those who choose to move typically differ in a host of observable and unobservable ways from those who choose to stay behind. This paper provides an overview of a new experimental literature which uses policy experiments and researcher-designed experiments to overcome these selection issues. Particular emphasis is placed on discussing the different datagathering strategies needed for conducing policy experiments. Experimental migration research as a field is still in its nascent stages, and there appears to be plenty of scope for both policymakers and researchers to design new experiments going forward - it is hoped that the summary here will aid researchers and policymakers in this purpose.", "keywords": ["Experiments", "Migration", "Selection"]}

In our model simulations, we allow for multiple nonlinearities: an occasionally binding effective lower bound (ELB) on the short-term policy rate; a state-dependent and calender-based interest rate forward guidance; state-dependent asset purchases conducted only at the ELB. There are four main results. First, state-dependent forward guidance can reduce the volatility of the economy in comparison to unconditional calendar-based forward guidance. Second, the ELB induces a large negative in ation bias if the central bank has only its short-term policy rate at its disposal. Third, asset purchases that are initiated only at the ELB can provide significant in ation stabilisation, but it remains uncertain whether they allow the distortions created by the ELB to be fully off- set. This is the case, for instance, when an upper limit on purchases is imposed. Fourth, an appropriate reinvestment strategy might help to mitigate the limits of asset purchases.", "keywords": ["Effective lower bound", "forward guidance", "reinvestment", "state-dependent asset purchases"]}

When operators of these networks face increasing demand or the need to handle more diverse transport situations, they regularly seek to expand the capacity of their network by building new pipelines parallel to existing ones (“looping”). The paper introduces a new mixed-integer nonlinear programming model and a new nonlinear programming model and compares these with existing models for the looping problem and related problems in the literature, both theoretically and experimentally. On this basis, we give recommendations to practitioners about the circumstances under which a certain model should be used. In particular, it turns out that one of our novel models outperforms the existing models with respect to computational time, the number of solutions found, the number of instances solved and cost savings. Moreover, the paper extends the models for optimizing over multiple demand scenarios and is the first to include the practically relevant option that a particular pipeline may be looped several times.", "keywords": ["Nonlinear programming", "Potential-driven networks"]}

It requires significant upfront investment, while not being assured of sufficient timely revenues to cover for it. Although many studies focus on modeling the costs and forecasting the revenues, limited research deals with how both sides can impact the overall business case. This paper compares different deployment strategies used in current FTTH network rollouts, and examines their impact on the overall business case. Deployment strategies are defined as ways to plan the installation of the network and uptake over time, influenced by a variety of situation-dependent characteristics. By studying the different parameters that allow characterizing and grouping ongoing FTTH projects worldwide, we can analyze what drove the choice for the deployment strategy, and how the latter impacts both cost and revenue side of the business case. The paper concludes that deployments driven by demand are less risky and therefore more sustainable. On the other hand, publicly funded or initiated projects obey to different goals than demand and can be unsustainable if they are not able to engage the planned penetration rates.", "keywords": ["business case", "deployment strategy", "Fiber-to-the-Home"]}

Using panel local projections for 48 advanced and emerging market economies (EMEs), we study the impact of country-specific temperature shocks on a range of prices: consumer prices, including the food and non-food components, producer prices and the GDP deflator. Hot summers increase food price inflation in the near term, especially in EMEs. But over the medium term, the impact across the various price indices tends to be either insignificant or negative. Such effect is largely non-linear, being more significant for larger shocks and at higher absolute temperatures.

In this backdrop, this paper provides a state-of-the-art summary of empirical archival on determinants and effects of Ind AS for the post-2010 period. To this end, the study employs the systematic literature review method following the Scientific Procedure and Rationales for the Systematic Literature Review approach. A total of 50 articles retrieved from the Scopus and Web of Science database between 2010 and 2024 were reviewed. The results revealed that the perceived benefits of IFRS, globalization, and the urge to enhance reporting quality are the key drivers of IFRS convergence in India. Regarding impact, the review uncovered that Ind AS has increased the quality of financial reporting, value relevance, and firm performance. However, it has led to a decline in the ethical reporting of the firms. Further, Ind AS witnessed the increased length and complexity of financial statements, causing problems with the readability of the reports. Overall, the observed learning curve effect strongly suggested that the Ind AS will have a favourable impact on the Indian accounting realm moving forward.

The specifications suggest that unemployment results in lower health and the deterioration of mental health during the 2008-2009 period compared with the 2010-2013 period, i.e., a period in which the country's unemployment doubled as a consequence of the financial crisis. Unemployment seems to be more detrimental to health/mental health in periods of high unemployment, suggesting that the unemployment crisis in Greece is more devastating as it concerns more people. Importantly, in all specifications, comparable qualitative patterns are found by controlling for unemployment due to firm closure, which allows us to minimize potential bias due to unemployment-health related reverse causality. Moreover, in all cases, women are more negatively affected by unemployment in relation to their health and mental health statuses than are men. Greece has been more deeply affected by the financial crisis than any other EU country, and this study contributes by offering estimates for before and during the financial crisis and considering causality issues.

New Zealand has only experienced a limited number of exchange rate cycles since the dollar was floated.

New Zealand, Australia and Japan face the highest levels of short-term volatility out of the economies included in the analysis. Factors that affect the expected relative return on New Zealand dollar assets are found to explain a significant part of exchange rate cycles. These include interest rate differentials between New Zealand and other countries, relative growth performance and attitudes to risk.

Naturally, these processes did not occur homogeneously throughout the territories. Through the last decade, population in suburbs has largely increased while the population living in Central Business Districts has generally shrunk in many of the European and American cities. Portugal is not an exception and several cities have been largely affected by this phenomenon, suffering significant changes in their economic structure and characteristics, particularly through residences and jobs ?relocation? to the suburbs. Our main aim is to establish the theoretical design of a modelling framework to assess social, economic, energy and environmental impacts of changes in urban forms and commuting patterns in the regions studied. Accordingly, we will use a multi-regional input-output model which considers the areas defined as the Central Business District (Lisbon municipality), the suburbs (North Lisbon metropolitan area and Setubal Peninsula) and the ?Rest of the country?. The model will then be extended with satellite accounts regarding social, energy, environment and mobility issues, in order to assess the (direct, indirect and induced) multidimensional effects of commuting felt within each metropolitan region and the ones that leak to other regions. This model has as an innovative feature, the fact that it distinguishes the final consumption of three types of households: the ones which do not commute, the ones which commute to other regions, and the ones who are real estate owners. Finally, the model will comprise a commuting satellite account which will allow to deal with the impacts on income, employment, energy requirements and emissions among regions, as well as with resulting changes both in the consumption patterns and in the location/region where consumption actually takes place. This modelling framework should allow for the assessment of the multidimensional impacts resulting from several scenarios reproducing real and/or hypothetical changes in commuters? behaviour and in the policy measures, such as, e.g.: modifications in household location, changes in travelling patterns and commuting distances, external shocks in the economies of these regions, the delocalization of industries or headquarters between regions, the implementation of specific (local, regional or national) policy measures.", "keywords": ["Commuting", "Environmental", "Multiregional Input-Output", "Satellite Account"]}

One major issue is that CE is in danger of becoming an end in itself, with the goal of completely closed material cycles.

To contribute to this ongoing discussion, we focus in our article on the recycling of metals as part of CE and its contribution to climate protection, as one of the main aspects of sustainable development. Based on life cycle assessment and substance flow modelling carried out in our previous works, we show that metal recycling in most cases requires much less energy and therefore results in much lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions than primary production. However, this is by no means without limitations. We show empirically that metal concentration is a significant factor that determines the energy required for recycling. If the metals are too diluted in the technosphere, as it is indeed the case for several metal applications, their recycling require much more energy than the alternative primary production, and thus intensifying rather than mitigating climate change.", "keywords": ["Climate change", "Metal recycling"]}

Examples include business gifts of firms and lobbyists. In a series of experiments, we show that, even without incentive or informational effects, small gifts strongly influence the recipient’s behavior in favor of the gift giver, in particular when a third party bears the cost. Subjects are well aware that the gift is given to influence their behavior but reciprocate nevertheless. Withholding the gift triggers a strong negative response. These findings are inconsistent with the most prominent models of social preferences. We propose an extension of existing theories to capture the observed behavior by endogenizing the “reference group” to whom social preferences are applied.

Then, we illustrate how some small (organic) raw milk producers have changed their position in the value chain and bargaining strength by following different upgrading strategies.

This theoretical perspective is supported by the empirical evidence regarding the limited impact of past ‘information revolutions’ on least developed countries (LDCs) and the present impact of the Internet on advanced economies. Furthermore, LDCs appear ill-prepared to benefit from those opportunities that the Internet does present—they lack the physical and human capital, along with the institutions required to exploit the e-economy.

The increase in test scores mostly comes from the lower half of the test score distribution and from native adolescents with lower maternal education. The empirical design embeds a framework where the estimated refugee impact can solely be attributed to the labor market mechanism. In particular, I use the observation that refugee adolescents are enrolled more systematically into the Turkish education system after 2016, which gave me the opportunity to use 2015 and 2018 PISA waves in a way to isolate the the effect of the labor market mechanism from the potentially negating force coming from the education experience mechanism.

In this paper we are looking at the dynamics of the areas planted with apple during the period 2010-2016, the dynamics of the total and average outputs, as well as the dynamics of the capitalization prices on each county. The purpose of the paper is to make some recommendations that might be useful to Romanian producers who choose apple for their business.", "keywords": ["apple", "capitalization prices", "production"]}

One of the major concerns of this Plan is a strategic use of intangible assets as an instrument for profit shifting. The main purpose of this paper is to test whether multinational enterprises use intangibles as an important BEPS channel by empirically analysing the relationship between taxation and bilateral royalty flows. We employ the OECD data on 3,660 country-pairs for the time period of 1990-2012 and apply the Poisson pseudo-maximum likelihood estimator in a fixed-effects framework. The main results point to a negative impact of taxation on bilateral royalty flows. Moreover, we find that tax differentials, which represent a relative level of taxation in a recipient state compared to other potential royalty recipients, have a significant influence on royalty payments as well. For tax policy considerations, the paper provides various insights to the ongoing work on BEPS by the G20, the OECD, and the European Commission. For example, we find that such reform suggestions of the OECD Action Plan as an enforcement of the Nexus Approach, as well as an introduction of strict Controlled Foreign Company rules and transfer pricing regulations are likely to reduce international royalty flows.", "keywords": ["intangible assets", "royalty"]}

However, little is known about the effects of differential enforcement that is not defined by the letter of the law, presumably due to the lack of data. Our study incorporates aspects of both types of differential enforcement as we combine the evaluation of a partial reform with information on the more difficult-to-observe enforcement of the same reform in collective agreements. We analyse a reform of notice periods for employer-initiated separations in Sweden, which reduced the notice periods for newly hired older workers substantially but implied minor or no changes in the notices for younger workers. The reform was initiated at different times depending on collective agreement. These circumstances provide ample opportunity for the identification of its effects. Our findings indicate heterogeneous effects across collective agreements. Despite differences in terms of dynamics and size, a positive effect on hirings is found for all agreements. In most cases, our results also show an increase in separations, indicating an increase in employment turnover. A salient feature of the results is that the estimated effects increase with the treatment dose, i.e., the size of the reduction in notice periods across different age groups.", "keywords": ["Collective agreements", "Employment protection", "Hirings", "Separations"]}

However, in contrast to other value-creating factors, human capital is more difficult to measure, evaluate and manage. Due to human capital's great importance for economic value creation, a series of studies on human capital evaluation have been published during the last few years. This paper discusses why so many traditional evaluation methods are only partly appropriate for categorizing, analyzing and evaluating human capital's special characteristics. In particular, it is difficult for many traditional approaches to integrate notions of flexibility and options with regard to the human capital of companies. Our result shows that the real options theory provides a theoretical framework for the evaluation of human capital and allows a differentiated analysis that, on a qualitative basis, enables investments in uncertainties that are associated with human capital. This theory thus forms the foundation for the quantification of human capital's inherent opportunities and risks. Consequently, this paper provides approaches for the future evaluation of human capital and a conceptual context for empirical studies.", "keywords": ["human capital", "real options"]}

Our overall results suggest that there exists no significant difference in performance in response to monetary, non-monetary, and mixed incentives.

The gender differences in the effectiveness of monetary and non-monetary incentives do not seem to be triggered by the perceived attractiveness of the non-monetary incentives but rather by the differences between men and women in the feelings of appreciation and perceived performance pressure in a tournament setting.

To clarify the role of measurement error, we restate the Dunning Kruger effect in terms of skill and overconfidence.

For consumers, use of private motor vehicles and consumption of meat and dairy are high-impact behaviours. To assist behaviour change, it is useful to understand where in the process of change people currently are and what motivates the next step. In a pre-registered study using a representative sample of adults (N = 1200), we measure \"stage of change\" for transport and diet behaviours, then test the relationship between stage of change and a battery of psychological variables informed by previous theoretical and empirical research. Our modelling approach allows us to test whether the variables associated with change depend on the stage an individual is moving to and from. The models reveal that, for both transport and dietary behaviours, people who intend to change worry more about climate change and feel more morally responsible to act than people who see no need to change. Acting on intentions is associated with holding a strong environmental identity. We also find differences between the two behaviours in the variables associated with stage of change. For example, positive environmental attitudes predict intentions and actions only for transport behaviour, whereas belief in the effectiveness of collective action predicts intention to change diet. Sociodemographic predictors of change also differ between behaviours: urban dwellers are more likely to act on transport intentions, while being a woman predicts intentions and action for dietary change. Other psychological variables cited in the literature have little association with change, including social norms and belief in individual responsibility. The results show the benefit of conceptualising behaviour change as a multi-stage process.", "keywords": ["climate change", "diet", "stage of change", "transport"]}

In the second-best efficient Wilson-Miyazaki-Spence framework, we allow for consumers to reveal their risk type for an individual subjective cost and show analytically how this affects insurance market equilibria as well as utilitarian social welfare. Our analysis shows that the choice of information disclosure with respect to revelation of their risk type can substitute deductibles for consumers whose transparency aversion is sufficiently low. This can lead to a Pareto improvement of social welfare and a Pareto efficient market allocation. However, if all consumers are offered cross-subsidizing contracts, the introduction of a transparency contract decreases or even eliminates cross-subsidies. Given the prior existence of a WMS equilibrium, utility is shifted from individuals who do not reveal their private information to those who choose to reveal.

The existing plant consists of a field of linear Fresnel collectors (LFC), integrated directly with two-tank thermal energy storage (TES) system, which interfaces with ORC power block.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper is based on a literature review and an empirical study. It provides a comprehensive literature review on VMI and an illustrative case study of a supplier and a buyer jointly implementing VMI. Findings: The findings of this paper are twofold. First, a literature review uncovers that contemporary research has delimited the analysis of VMI to a focal company perspective as current VMI cost models tend not to capture the picture of the complete supply chain. Second, it demonstrates through an illustrative case study that adoption of an inter-organisational approach to VMI is vital if companies are to optimize their buyer-supplier relationships. Research limitations/implications: Future research should test the implications proposed in the empirical section, as this piece of research can be seen as exploratory case study research with the aim of analytical generalizations. Practical implications: The inter-organisational VMI cost perspective in supply chains should be emphasized in purchasing departments since such a perspective significantly raises the awareness of the costs incurred in a supply chain.

Our results show that socio-economic processes play an important role in determining fertility, not only directly but also indirectly. We show that increasing attendance in higher education has a largely direct effect on early childbearing up to age 25 years, resulting in a substantial increase in childlessness. However, childbearing at later ages is dominated by an indirect effect of education on fertility, via partnership status and employment status, that is twice as large as the direct effect.

Evidence from Italy on migrant workers employability — The strong adverse selection that immigrants face in hosting labour markets may induce them to adopt some behaviours or signals to modify employers' beliefs. Relevant mechanisms for reaching this purpose are personal reputation; exploiting ethnic networks deeply-rooted in the hosting country; and high educational levels used as an indirect signal of productivity. On this last point, the immigrant status needs a stronger signal compared to that necessary for a local worker, and this may lead the immigrant to accept job qualifications which are lower than those achievable through the embodied educational level. This could explain the over education problem that characterizes many countries, Italy included. The aim of the paper is to investigate whether the above mentioned mechanisms are adopted by immigrants in Italy, a crucial country for EU immigration flows, and if they are useful in increasing immigrants' likelihood of employment. The empirical analysis has been conducted using the dataset from a national Labour Force Survey which provides information on 6,860 documented immigrants. We estimate a logit model for immigrants' likelihood of being employed, focusing on the above mentioned mechanisms: reputation, ethnic networks and educational level. Moreover we concentrate on the interaction effects of the mechanisms and investigate whether one of them wins on the others. Results show that each of the three mechanisms is statistically and economically significant and exerts positive influence: all factors contribute to increasing the immigrant's probability of being employed. Anyway, a high level of education increases the probability of being employed more than the belonging to ethnic networks deeply-rooted in Italy. The specific embodied capital of workers matter relatively more. This is relevant for labour public policies in this specific realm since the human capital lever is a possible direct target of various public policies and private human capital investments.", "keywords": ["Reputation"]}

As a result, it is proven-for the first time-that in isolation, investments and corporate social responsibility do not contribute positively to sustainable development.

Based on this, a new approach to crisis management of sustainable development is developed-it is based on stimulating corporate social responsibility, for which the complex recommendations in the sphere of state management are offered. The theoretical significance of the conclusions made consists in specifying the essence of financial risk management of sustainable development, which has to be conducted with a strict connection to and based on corporate social responsibility.

One might say it is bigger than ever, with a constantly proliferating range of cleantech companies and business models. In the midst of the resurgence, Finnish CleanTech has been recognized globally. Recent rankings by the WWF (WWF & Cleantech Group (2014): The Global Cleantech Innovation Index 2014) placed Finland in the top-3 of global leaders in cleantech, along with Israel and the US. Against this backdrop, this report takes a closer look at the Finnish commercial cleantech space and scrutinizes it in light of select indicators such as degree of specialization into cleantech, type of industrial activity, generation of value added, financial performance as well as type and volume of intellectual property generated. The results are thought-provoking. Of the many discoveries made in the report, three strike as critical: First, the Finnish cleantech space is dominated by manufacturing-driven businesses. Second, consumer-oriented technical innovations seem to be rare. And third, the engine of industrial renewal – the layer of small and medium-sized firms – seems to struggle with financial sustainability. The ability to shift gears from manufacturing- to service-driven businesses may be compromised if the low financial viability of small and medium -sized companies turns out to be more than a statistical fluke. These firms have been known to possess the rare capability to mock conventional industry boundaries to develop novel business models and open new markets. Poor commercial performance would indeed be bad news for the long-term development of the cleantech space in Finland. To solidify these results, uncover the reasons behind them, and identify opportunities going forward, however, more in-depth inquiries need to be made. In the gold rush era of digitalization, our findings beg the question whether the seemingly dominant focus on manufacturing, engineering and technology could become the ball-and-chain to the growth of Finnish cleantech. Digitalization is currently revolutionizing service businesses and providing opportunities to harness vast consumer markets for rapid, scalable growth – particularly in the area of resource efficiency – via new, often disruptive business models. In recent years these opportunities have been widely discussed in several contexts including cleanweb, smart cities, internet of things, and consumer cleantech. Should the Finnish cleantech industry do what the Finns have always done best and stick to the development of cutting-edge technological solutions? Or should Finnish companies adopt service-based business models that have allowed other countries (notably the US) to transition to the digital age of cleantech?", "keywords": ["Cleantech", "Cleanweb", "Digitalization", "Industrial renewal"]}

Determinants and trends of currency in circulation in a panel of 17 economies — Digital payments are growing rapidly, and the use of cash seems to be declining, at least in advanced economies in Europe and the U.S. However, the literature on payment systems provides an interesting perspective- cash, or currency, when measured as a percentage of the gross domestic product, has not been falling as clearly as might be intuited. Contrarily, many economies face an increase in currency in circulation rates. This paper discusses this topic in literature and explores the determinants of currency in circulation in a panel of 17 countries between 2001-2022 and whether determinants from prior literature are also significant across a group of heterogeneous countries. Interest rates are found to affect the demand for cash significantly and negatively, while tax revenues have a significantly positive impact.

By separating the data into three distinct periods, pre-crisis (2000-2007), European sovereign debt crisis (2008-2015), and post-crisis (2016-2023), we examine the potential synchronization of the debt ratios among EU countries through cross-correlations of the public debts.

A significantly lower network density is observed in both the pre- and post-crisis periods. These results contribute to the overall debate on fiscal stability and policy coordination by showing how EU countries tend to align their fiscal behaviors during periods of crisis while behaving more independently during stable times. In addition, we yield a deeper insight into how economic shocks reorganize public debt interconnections within the crisis period.

Their future effects and costs is of increasing intrest and a growing number of research papers hence investigate climate change impacts and climate change adaptation. However, research focused mainly on the US economy and or on the agricultural sector. Other papers concentrated on the losses in GDP. Against this background, this paper examines the macro-economic costs of climate change in Germany taking also social dimensions such as SDG indicators into account. We used a model-based scenario-analysis that allowed us to identify the costs of climate change on sectoral level and on level of different household types. The impact of three intensities of climate change (low, medium, high) was assessed on GDP, on selected indictors of the UN sustainable development goals (SDGs) as well as on inequality using household income of different household types. The findings of this study indicate that the economic costs of climate change measured by the changes in GDP have the potential to be substantially high even under conservative assumptions. Strong effects on GDP are triggered in particular by those climate effects that lead to significant price increases such as yield losses in agriculture, damages to buildings and infrastructure and impariments in international trade. The results also indicate that it is worthwhile to assess socioeconomic effects beyond GDP: climate change would increase income inequality and deteriorate in particular national SDG indicators 2 (Zero Hunger) and 10 (Reduced Inequalities). The results illustrate the high need for action in climate mitigation and adaptation and highlight the importance of taking into account not only macroeconomic effects but also social dimensions.", "keywords": ["climate change", "SDG"]}

We revisit the relationship between education and remitting behavior using microdata from surveys of immigrants in eleven major destination countries. The data show a mixed pattern between education and the likelihood of remitting, and a strong positive relationship between education and the amount remitted conditional on remitting. Combining these intensive and extensive margins gives an overall positive effect of education on the amount remitted. The microdata then allow investigation as to why the more educated remit more.

The introduction and adoption of tools that facilitate technological changes and online business practices have emerged as game changers. They have endowed corporations with enhanced internal agility and improved employee communications. Online business, with its vast potential, is becoming increasingly crucial in developing countries, where Internet accessibility is steadily growing. This study explores the impact of e-commerce on company productivity by considering both formal and informal sectors. It leverages data from the 2018 General Business Census of Togo. By applying endogenous switching regression and smoothed instrumental variable quantile regression tools, this study demonstrates that online businesses can significantly increase productivity, particularly in firms within the informal sector.

In particular, in our model the long-run relationship between effective exchange rates and domestic as well as weighted foreign prices is a homogeneous function of a country's international investment position. We find rather strong support for purchasing power parity in environments of limited negative net foreign asset to GDP positions, but not outside such environments. We thus argue that the purchasing power parity hypothesis holds conditionally, but not unconditionally, and that international investment positions are an essential component to characterizing this conditionality. Finally, we adduce evidence that whether deterioration of a country's net foreign asset to GDP position leads to a depreciation of that country's effective exchange rate depends on its rate of inflation relative to the rate of inflation abroad as well as its exposure to global shocks.", "keywords": ["Dynamic Panel Data Models", "Exchange Rate Determination"]}

In the first model, the government does not engage in any type of redistributive policies - except for the payment of unemployment benefits; we find that the MW is preferred by the majority of workers (even when the unemployed receive very generous unemployment benefits). In the second model, the government engages in redistribution through the public provision of private goods. We show that (i) the introduction of a MW can be preferred by a majority of workers only if the unemployed receive benefits which are substantially below the after-tax earnings they would have had in the perfectly competitive case, (ii) for a given generosity of the unemployment benefit scheme, the maximum, politically viable, MW is lower than in the absence of in-kind redistribution, and (iii) the MW institution is politically viable only when there is a limited degree of in-kind redistribution. These findings can possibly explain why a well-developed social safety net in Scandinavia tends to co-exist with the absence of a national MW, whereas in Southern Europe the MW institution \"complements\" the absence of a well-developed social safety net.", "keywords": ["in-kind redistribution", "minimum wage", "unemployment"]}

China's expanding ambitions to become an international standard-setter compelled a Japanese response. Shinzo Abe's government has initiated strategies such as the Partnership for Quality Infrastructure. This paper juxtaposes the Chinese and Japanese approaches to securing their position in the global governance of infrastructure finance, with a particular focus on the high-speed railway industry. It posits that economic statecraft has diffused from Japan to China and then back to Japan. In emulating Chinese economic statecraft, Japan has increased state involvement in infrastructure project exports and centralized authority within the Prime Minister's Office. The permeation of such statecraft and the apparent escalation of Sino-Japanese competition bear significant consequences for regional trade and developmental cooperation regimes. This heightened competition may initially afford South and Southeast Asian nations a broader choice of service and infrastructure providers. In the long run, if the competition solidifies, secondary states might find themselves compelled to integrate into either China's hub-and-spoke model or Japan's reinvigorated production networks. Moreover, such integration could render secondary states dependent on the technology and finance supplied by regional great powers. However, the eventual structure of the region will likely depend on how these two major powers navigate their rivalry.

In particular, the model shows how housing prices can have a 'bubbly' appearance in which housing wealth rises faster than income for an extended period, then collapses and experiences an extended decline. The paper also uses micro data to calibrate a key cross-elasticity parameter that governs the relationship between productivity growth and home price appreciation. Combined with a realistic model of learning about the productivity process, the model is able to capture the medium- and low-frequency fluctuations of both price and quantity from the residential sector.

All previous attempts to capture inequality in the HDI have also used aggregate information and there exists no HDI at the household level. We provide a method for proxying the HDI at the household level. This allows the analysis of the HDI by any kind of population subgroups and by household socioeconomic characteristics as well as to apply any kind of inequality measure across population subgroups and over time. We illustrate our approach for 15 developing countries. Inequality in the HDI is stunningly large for some countries, driven mostly by very high inequality in the education and income components of the HDI. The inequality in human development is larger than previously reported which is largely due to the new procedures for calculating the HDI used in the 2010 Human Development Report.

H-1B Visas and the Career Choices of International Students in the United States — For the first time since the inception of the H-1B visa, yearly caps became binding in 2004, making it harder for most foreign-born students to secure employment in the United States. However, since the year 2000, institutions of higher education and related non-profit research institutes had been exempt from the cap. We explore how immigrant employment choices were impacted by the binding visa cap, exploiting the fact that citizens of five countries (Canada, Mexico, Chile, Singapore and Australia) had access to alternate work visas. Our estimates suggest that international students from H-1B dependent countries became more likely to work in academic institutions if they graduated after 2004 than immigrants from the five countries with substitute work visas. Within academia, foreign-born graduates affected by the visa cap became more likely to work in a job unrelated to their field of study, while no such change occurred in the private sector –a finding consistent with the notion of workers \"settling for academia.\" We conclude with an analysis of workforce compositional changes in the academic versus private sectors as a result of the binding visa caps.", "keywords": ["H-1B visas", "United States"]}

In the model, the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) works for investors' probability distribution.  However, mis-pricing can be observed if econometricians estimate betas without accounting for the investors' learning process.  The empirical implication for asset-pricing tests is that the factor loadings must be estimated as latent variables.  We provide an empirical application of this methodology to the cross section of returns on ten book-to-market and ten size-sorted portfolios.

The continuous-updating GMM estimator proposed by Hansen, Heaton, and Yaron (1996) is in principle able to reduce the small-sample bias, but it involves high-dimensional optimizations when the number of regressors is large. This paper proposes a computationally feasible variation on these standard two-step GMM estimators by applying the idea of continuous-updating to the autoregressive parameter only, given the fact that the absolute value of the autoregressive parameter is less than unity as a necessary requirement for the data-generating process to be stationary. We show that our subset-continuous-updating method does not alter the asymptotic distribution of the two-step GMM estimators, and it therefore retains consistency. Our simulation results indicate that the subset-continuous-updating GMM estimators outperform their standard two-step counterparts in finite samples in terms of the estimation accuracy on the autoregressive parameter and the size of the Sargan-Hansen test.", "keywords": ["dynamic panel data models", "subset-continuous-updating GMM estimators"]}

To define each of these solutions, we consider a certain mapping that transforms any hierarchical structure into a levels structure, and then we apply the standard generalization of the Shapley Value to the class of games with levels structure.

We contrast the rates and wage returns associated with different types of job moves, including moving employer for family reason, moving for wage or career-related reasons, and changing jobs but remaining with the same employer. Despite overall levels of mobility being similar for men and women, we find important differences in the types of mobility they experience, with mothers most likely to switch employers for family related reasons and least likely to move for wage or career reasons, or to change jobs with the same employer. We find that, while job changes with the same employer and career related employer changes have large positive wage returns, changing employers for family related reasons is associated with significant wage losses.

The more a relationship involves collaboration and creative, non-standardised customer solutions, the more there is potential for the development of the supplier’s competencies – but also for a conflict of interests pertaining to the intellectual property rights (IPRs) to the output. IPRs provide the right to economically exploit and further develop an intellectual asset. The impact of a contract allocating IPRs, and thereby partly conditioning the ex post utilisation of relationship-related knowledge, has been commonly ignored in business economics literature. The increased knowledge-intensity of products has, however, increased technology firms’ concern with protecting their intellectual assets that often underlies competitive advantage and company value. This paper provides a theoretical analysis of the determinants likely to affect allocation of IPRs in buyer-supplier relationships. It also concerns consequent implications for the development of the suppliers’ competitive advantage and diversification as a means to decrease possible dependence of the main customer. Contracting on asset ownership in vertical relationships inherently involves bargaining power and incentives to make relationship-specific investments.

Quality of Life and the level of satisfaction with this Quality are determined through values which are subjectively defined by an individual as to how his or her needs are met, for example, by the quality of goods and services. For the political system of any country, the most important strategic concept must be oriented towards preferences that reflect the basic needs and choices of the people. Without understanding such concept it is impossible to sustain market development and substantially improve the Quality of Life. Under the influence of globalization and economic integration various processes across the Global Marketplace move towards conversion of and collision of values of people in the Developed and Emerging Market Countries. This process requires a more unified systemic quality management, starting from managing the quality of goods and services, public governance and ultimately resulting in managing the Quality of Life. In this regard, the study of the authors is aimed at the development and application of various methods of the Economics for Quality, as well as at assessing the impact of Quality on the modernization of economic systems and creating the conditions for their continued sustainable development. Economics for Quality involves the economic analysis and the development of management models - management systems, which can be used at all levels of corporate and state governance in order to ensure sustainable development. Quality Management Systems are a vital part of an innovative socio-economic life and facilitate the generation of initiatives. As the Global Community heads towards a knowledge-based economy using the intellectual potential as the predominant economic force at the Global Marketplace, Quality Management Systems will require worldwide implementation. If Quality Management Systems are practiced in full, then the quality of life in any country regardless of its socio-economic system will increase. Thus, the authors have analyzed the philosophical and political-economic bases of development within a sample of economic systems, looking for the reasons that could explain the difference in the Quality of Life levels in terms of different economic systems, and developing ideas and proposals for managing the Quality of Life based on our findings.

We empirically assess the relevance of these relationships using fixed effects linear probability models and inverse probability weighting regression adjustment on US data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health.

This reveals that paternal crime imposes a double penalty on children: it increases their probability of committing crimes later on in life both directly and indirectly via school dropout. When considering the role of the environment, we find that while an early exposure to high levels of crime exacerbates dropping out, it has no direct long-term effect on adult crime.

The relationship is characterized by an open and people-friendly border and is built on shared historical, cultural, linguistic, ethnic links between people residing in India and Nepal. With Nepal being a priority under India \"Neighborhood First\" policy, strengthening the economic relationship holds immense significance and potential for both the countries. India is Nepal's largest export market, the biggest source of its imports and the top investor of foreign capital stock. India also provides Nepal transit facility through its territory to access sea ports for trading with rest of the world. Given this, the main objective of this paper is to suggest policy measures which can increase bilateral trade and investment between India and Nepal. We analyse the bilateral trade patterns and estimate the maximum additional trade potential. We discuss a wide range of issues of importance pertaining to bilateral trade, including tariffs, levy of an agricultural reform fee, under-utilization of the tariff rate quota, non-tariff measures, issues related to ROO and physical barriers to cross-border movement of goods. We also analyse the trend and changing sectoral composition of India's investment in Nepal. We discuss barriers and opportunities for Indian investment in Nepal. The paper concludes by charting a way forward for bolstering economic cooperation between the two countries by listing down recommendations for enhancing trade, addressing non-tariff barriers, upgrading infrastructure to improve connectivity and enhancing Indian FDI in Nepal.", "keywords": ["Bilateral Trade", "India-Nepal", "Non-Tariff Barriers"]}

We demonstrate that many of the effects of the referendum result can be conceptualised as news about a future slowdown in productivity growth in the tradable sector. Simulations show that the responses of the model economy to such news are consistent with key patterns in UK data. While overall economic growth slows, an immediate permanent fall in the relative price of non-tradable output (the real exchange rate) induces a temporary 'sweet spot' for tradable producers before the slowdown in tradable sector productivity associated with Brexit occurs. Resources are reallocated towards the tradable sector, tradable output growth rises and net exports increase. These developments reverse after the productivity decline in the tradable sector materialises. The negative news about tradable sector productivity also leads to a decline in domestic interest rates relative to world interest rates and to a reduction in investment growth, while employment remains relatively stable.

Special Civil Tribunals increased the geographic presence of the justice system, simplified judicial procedures, and increased the speed of adjudication of disputes.

A universal-coverage health care system and a high level of access to information are judged to be equivalent to $12,000-$14,000 in per capita income. We use the estimated coefficients and country sociodemographics to construct an index of adaptive capacity for several countries.

In this paper we investigate the likely future of post-Kyoto policies. Our primary objective is to identify policy-relevant abatement scenarios and to quantify the associated economic implications across major world regions. Based on a cross-impact analysis we first evaluate an expert poll to select the most likely post-Kyoto climate policy scenarios. We then use a computable general equilibrium model to assess the economic implications of these key scenarios. We find that post-Kyoto agreements are likely to cover only small reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions with abatement duties predominantly assigned to the industrialized countries while developing countries do not make any commitments, but can sell emission abatement to the industrialized world. Equity rules to allocate abatement duties are mainly based on the sovereignty principle or ability-to-pay.

Understanding the intricate relationship between GDP and unemployment is crucial for navigating the dynamic business environment. This study investigates this relationship in Somalia using both frequentist and Bayesian regression approaches. The frequentist approach, particularly ordinary least squares, is chosen for its widespread use and simplicity in estimating parameters by minimizing the sum of squared deviations. Meanwhile, the Bayesian approach is adopted for its flexibility in integrating prior information and updating estimates as new data emerge, providing a probabilistic framework that accommodates parameter uncertainty. Secondary data from the World Bank spanning 1991-2020 were analyzed. The results reveal a significant negative association between unemployment and GDP in both models. Comparative analysis employing mean absolute error, root mean square error, and mean square error indicates comparable predictive accuracy between the two approaches, with the Bayesian model demonstrating slight advantages. Bayesian convergence diagnostics affirm satisfactory model stability. These findings offer valuable insights for policymakers, aiding in the formulation of strategies to address unemployment challenges and stimulate economic growth in Somalia. The study investigates the relationship between unemployment and GDP in Somalia, employing both frequentist and Bayesian statistical methods. The frequentist approach provides point estimates and confidence intervals based on observed data, while the Bayesian approach incorporates prior knowledge and uncertainty into the analysis, yielding posterior distributions.

The reason for this economic exploration of theatres is in the fact that the service they provide fall under collectively provided public goods (a common feature of most cultural institutions), and that the market is not able to effectively secure these goods on the profit principle. The J. K. Tyl Theatre in Pilsen, the Drak Theatre in Hradec Králové and the Moravian Slovakia Theatre in Uherské Hradiště have reported the best results of profitability indicators. Whereas the worst results in profitability have been reported for the North Bohemian Theatre of Opera and Ballet in Ústí nad Labem, the Antonín Dvořák Theatre in Příbram and the South Bohemian Theatre in České Budějovice. The rate of income self-sufficiency within 2011-2015 ranges from 12-55% of the total budget volume, and volume and shows a strong dependency of professional theatres on foreign resources, particularly from public resources of the local levels of the government being the most common funder of these cultural institutions.

In a competitive market, running a business smoothly in a highly suitable place is day by day becoming tough due to the very high fare for those locations. Thus, limited storage is available in those elite places with high fares, and a retailer takes a financial risk by stocking huge amounts of products in those limited storage stores. Thus, the appropriate financial analysis is required to find out optimal strategies (financial decisions) to sustain a business organization of electronic products in a global competitive business environment. As a result, when bulk purchases of electronic products, for example, T.V., Fridges, Oven, etc., have been made by the retailer, he faces two problems. The first one is related to the limited storage; as a result, he has to pay a considerable amount to hold the products for a long time. The second one is shortages of liquid money as he invested massive amounts. To avoid these problems, he offers some price discounts on the market's original selling price to sell the products quickly for a limited time prior to recovering his capital investment. For that reason, a price, time, and stock dependent realistic demand function have been considered in this proposed paper with two modes of discount policy.

Methods/Approach: Selected key figures are applied to observe if and how the dominance has changed. The different rating service range offered by the registered rating agencies in the EU is also considered in the analysis. Results: The re-search results show that new agencies potentially impact the EU rating market. While the three major rating agencies still dominate the market, they do so within a chang-ing environment. Conclusions: The employment of external ratings is significant in the financial sector. Ratings provide relevant information on the default risk of financial instruments and assess the solvency of issuers. The market for external ratings thereby can be classified as oligopolistic.

Managing Longevity Risk via Product Design — Longevity risk has become a major challenge for governments, individuals, and annuity providers in most countries, and especially its aggregate form, i.e. the risk of unsystematic changes to general mortality patterns, bears a large potential for accumulative losses for insurers. As obvious risk management tools such as (re)insurance or hedging are less suited to manage an annuity provider’s exposure to aggregate longevity risk, the current paper proposes a new type of life annuities with benefits contingent on actual mortality experience, and it also details actuarial aspects of implementation. Similar adaptations to conventional product design exist in investment-linked annuities, and a role model for long-term contracts contingent on actual cost experience is found in German private health insurance so that the idea is not novel in general, but it is in the context of longevity risk. By not or re-transferring the systematic longevity risk insurers may avoid accumulative losses so that the primary focus in an extensive Monte-Carlo simulation is on the question of whether and to what extent such products are also advantageous for policyholders in contrast to a comparable conventional annuity product.", "keywords": ["Longevity risk", "mortality-indexed annuities"]}

In a two-countries world where one country has a Hick's neutral technological edge over the other, tasks in which the productivity edge more than offsets offshoring costs get offshored, giving rise to global disintegration of the production process. Offshoring raises firms' productivity and the number of manufacturing firms in the offshoring countries, thereby reducing costs of living. The general equilibrium incidence of offshoring on labor demand is shown to depend on offshoring costs and trade costs. For high enough offshoring costs, interior equilibria where both countries still produce manufactured goods are likely to be sustained. In this case, offshoring will boost labor demand for low enough trade costs. If, on the other hand, offshoring costs are low enough, core-periphery equilibria with all manufacturing in the offshoring country are likely to emerge. In this case, manufacturing labor demand is positively affected by offshoring as long as offshoring costs are not too low.

The president of the US has proposed tariff increases, particularly on imports from Mexico and China to the US, while the threat of protectionism also involves more direct tariffs against EU exports to the US. We apply a measurement framework for the decomposition of value-added trade to the US grounded on hypothetical extraction, a mathematical technique based on an input-output representation of the global economy. Our results show that trade to the US continues to be an important source of the value added for Finland as well as the majority of the EU, even during the temporary slowdown of trade during the Great Recession. For many countries, trade to the US represents over 10% of the value added from exports to all countries. We find that a large majority of the value added for both Finland and the EU goes directly as intermediate or final goods and services to the US. Much less value added is generated via other countries through either their intermediate or direct final exports to the US. The other most important trade channel is through Germany. We investigate the effect of the trade barriers in several counterfactual scenarios. Using standard export elasticity estimates, we find that the value added generated by Finland and other EU countries through Mexico and China to the US would decline drastically if the US launched tariff rises on imports from Mexico and China to the US. The impacts would be significantly worse if the US raised tariff rates on direct imports from EU countries.", "keywords": ["GDP", "Tariff"]}

The topicality of this theme was the reason for resolving the main objectives, which were to determine how enterprises in the Czech Republic are currently involved in the circular economy. The authors focused on empirical research, the methodological framework of which contains three interrelated parts. The basis was secondary research from scientific databases, which was followed up by the primary research. The objects of the primary research were based on three research questions, which were focused on the use of standardised environmental activities, the identification of tools of the circular economy and determining their importance. The research was evaluated using the methods of content analysis, descriptive and inductive statistics. The research showed that 71 % of enterprises present themselves as taking an active approach to the environment beyond the scope of the statutory obligations. Enterprises then make most use of regulatory tools such as the ISO 14001 standard or Ecodesign. An in-depth interview was used to identify sixteen tools of the circular economy as they are perceived by enterprises. When assessing importance, the highest rated tool was reducing energy consumption in production, waste from production, the consumption of materials, emissions and minimization of waste. Statistically significant differences were also identified with these tools. The research showed that the circular economy is most used in automotive industry enterprise.", "keywords": ["circular economy"]}

Specifically, this research aims to assess the impact of ethical leadership as the independent variable on employees' intention to stay as the dependent variable. In addition, the influence of employee rewards as mediator in these correlations is also examined. The survey was conducted among 138 Gen-Y employees currently employed in various MNCs in Penang, Malaysia. Data analysis is done via IBM SPSS for respondent profiling and SmartPLS for the construct variable analysis of goodness of data, reliability analysis, and the hypothesis testing of independent and mediating variables. The results show that the independent variable of ethical leadership has no positive correlation to the intention to stay of Gen-Y employees of MNCs in Penang, Malaysia. At the same time, the independent variable of employee rewards observes its dimension of pay and recognition (work appreciation) positively correlated to the dependent variable, while the dimension of promotion is surprisingly not. Accordingly, pay and recognition were found to mediate the relationship of ethical leadership to intention to stay. The subject of employee retention and turnover has been a common area of research in the field of social science, yet most of the studies have been done outside the Malaysian context. Further, most of the older studies have become irrelevant due to the dramatic demographical changes in the workforce, where the transition of the generation cohort has become more apparent in recent years.

As a testing ground, we use data from a new historical database that includes annual panel data on approximately 2,400 Swedish rural geographical areas during the period 1860-1917. We use a staggered event study design that is robust to treatment effect heterogeneity. Importantly, we find extremely large reduced-form effects of having access to railways. For real nonagricultural income, the cumulative treatment effect is approximately 130% after 30 years. Equally important, we also show that our reduced-form effect is likely to reflect growth rather than a reorganization of existing economic activity since we find no spillover effects between treated and untreated regions. Specifically, our results are consistent with the big push hypothesis, which argues that simultaneous/coordinated investment, such as large infrastructure investment in railways, can generate economic growth if there are strong aggregate demand externalities (e.g., Murphy et al. 1989). We used plant-level data to further corroborate this mechanism. Indeed, we find that investments in local railways dramatically, and independent of initial conditions, increase local industrial production and employment on the order of 100-300% across almost all industrial sectors.", "keywords": ["Event study", "Railways", "Transport infrastructure"]}

Materials and methods: One hundred and fifty-three frail older people living at home were randomly assigned to either an intervention (n = 80) or a control group (n = 73). The 1-year intervention was carried out by nurses and physiotherapists working as case managers, who undertook home visits at least once a month. Differences in costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) based on the health-related quality-of-life instruments EQ-5D and EQ-VAS, and also the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio were investigated. All analyses used the intention-to-treat principle. Results: There were no significant differences between the intervention group and control group for total cost, EQ-5D-based QALY or EQ-VAS-based QALY for the 1-year study. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was not conducted because no significant differences were found for either EQ-5D- or EQ-VAS-based QALY, or costs.

Disagreement about real variables intensifes strongly during recessions, including the current one (by about 40 percent in terms of the interquartile range). Disagreement about nominal variables rises with their level, has fallen after 1998 or so (by 30 percent), and is considerably lower under independent central banks (by 35 percent).

According to the red herring hypothesis, the positive correlation between age and HCE is exclusively due to the fact that mortality rises with age and a large share of HCE is caused by proximity to death. As a consequence, rising longevity - through falling mortality rates - may even reduce HCE. However, a weakness of previous empirical studies is that they use cross-sectional evidence to make inferences on a development over time. In this paper we analyse the impact of rising longevity on the trend of HCE over time by using data for a pseudo-panel of German sickness fund members over the period 1997-2009. Using (dynamic) panel data models, we find that age, mortality and five-year survival rates have a positive impact on per-capita HCE. Our explanation for the last finding is that physicians treat patients more aggressively if they think the result will pay off for a longer time span, which we call Eubie Blake effect.

In our model economic development takes place and continues in the long run due to the emergence of new sectors, which can compensate for the diminishing ability of mature sectors to create employment and growth. Each new sector is created by a pervasive innovation, which creates a new market and into and out of which there are entry and exit of firms. Depending on the inter-temporal coordination of the maturation of older sectors and of the maturation of new ones our model can give rise to development paths with growth rates ranging from high to negative, to fluctuations, to bubbles and to chaos. In the construction of our model we found inspiration in a number of growth models, both endogenous and evolutionary as well as on empirical work on structural change. The model also bears some similarity of style to history friendly models. Its unique feature is that it gives rise to an endogenously variable number of sectors. Unless new sectors are exact substitutes of older ones the model gives rise to growing variety. In fact, the main objective for which the model was initially constructed was to test some propositions implying that variety growth is a necessary requirement for long term economic development. Within our model the ability to create new sectors at the right times is the crucial determinant of the growth potential of an economic system. Thus, inter country differences in the barriers to entry into new sectors can be expected to give rise to different rates of growth and in the end to increasingly skewed world income distribution.", "keywords": ["Economic Development", "International"]}

The literature emphasises the activities of these three institutions as indicators of social inclusion. Also, they accurately describe the social interactions of slum inhabitants at different levels. Design/methodology/approach - Three large slums (Makoko, Ilaje and Iwaya) in Lagos State were purposively selected for this study. Using a multi-stage sampling technique, there was the first level of cluster sampling across the communities and second-level random sampling of household heads in the clusters. In all, 400 respondents were sampled but 388 valid responses were used for the analysis. Findings - The study found minimal levels of inclusion in many of the indicators. However, Makoko had a higher degree of inclusion with respect to social relations and political participation compared to the other locations. Due to the poor level of governance, the resilience of slum dwellers has waned. Research limitations/implications - The study was limited to three of the largest slums in Lagos State. Moreover, due to threats of eviction in recent times, many respondents were reluctant to provide adequate answers to some of the questions asked. However, the responses gotten were adequate to provide appropriate awareness and relevant recommendations.

Using data from the 2006 PISA survey, we performed cross- classified multilevel analysis on the science performance of 9.279 15-year-old immigrant children, originating from 35 different countries, living in 16 Western countries of destination. We take into account a number of educational system characteristics of the countries of destination and origin, in order to measure the importance of differentiation, standardization, and the availability of resources. Our results show that differences in educational achievement between immigrants cannot be fully attributed to individual characteristics. Educational system characteristics of countries of destination and origin are also meaningful. At the origin level, the length of compulsory education positively influences educational performance. This is especially the case for immigrant pupils who attended education in their countries of origin. Results show that at the destination level, teacher shortage negatively affects immigrant pupil's scientific performance. Moreover, immigrant children perform less in highly stratified systems than they do in moderately differentiated or comprehensive ones.

However, due to technological changes there might not be as many cointegrating relationships as there are (independent) cost shares. The paper presents a flexible demand system that allows for both factor neutral technological changes as well as technological changes that affect the relative use of the different factors. The empirical tests indicate that there are fewer cointegrating relationships than usually implied by using conventional estimation approaches. This result is consistent with technological changes.

Results indicate that the opposition rate is far greater in plant biotechnology than in other emerging industries.

Using the occupational task descriptions provided in the Italian Indagine Campionaria delle Professioni, with additional indicators from the European Working Conditions survey, we estimate that 37% of dependent employment in the EU is currently teleworkable - very close to the estimates of teleworking indicated in real-time surveys during the COVID-19 crisis. Because of differences in the employment structure, the fraction of telewokable employment ranges between 33-44% in all but five EU member states. Even starker differences in teleworkability emerge between high- and low-paid workers, between white- and blue-collar workers, as well as by gender. Results suggests that that the large expansion of telework since the COVID-19 outbreak has been strongly skewed towards high-paid white-collar employment. Yet, enforced closures have likely resulted in many new teleworkers amongst low and mid-level clerical and administrative workers who previously had limited access to this working arrangement. This is consistent with the evidence showing that, beyond differences in the industrial and occupational structures, the pre-outbreak large differences in telework prevalence across EU countries were largely driven by other factors, notably the organisation of work, regulation, and management culture.

A systematic review based on author keywords from 855 publications analyzing scarcity affecting business-consumer interactions serves as a database. Exploratory factor analyses based on author keywords identify shared patterns within and linkages across discourses stemming from various disciplines and theories. Results differentiate distinct research foci in the consumer behavior, socio-political, and other disciplinary research realms. A mapping of these research themes identifies the scarcity-related interplay among consumers, producers, and other stakeholders. Findings point out research directions for future studies at both the research realm level and the interdisciplinary level.", "keywords": ["Author keywords", "Consumer behavior", "Scarcity", "Socio-political"]}

Die europäischen Strategien für die Verkehrsnetze wurden in diesem Zusammenhang als geeignetes Instrument angesehen. Noch wichtiger ist, dass die Verkehrspolitik die Raumentwicklung stark beeinflusst hat, da sie der ersten europäischen Raumordnungspolitik vorausging. Da Serbien unter internen sozialen und politischen Schwierigkeiten litt, wurde es von der Unterstützung ausgeschlossen, die den Mitgliedstaaten der Europäischen Union gewährt wurde. Aufgrund der geopolitischen Bedeutung des Westbalkans ist die gesamte Region jedoch zu einem interessanten Investitionsstandort für Russland, China, die Türkei und die Vereinigten Arabischen Emirate geworden. Die westlichen Balkanstaaten, die einen wirtschaftlichen Aufschwung dringend benötigen, sind in der Regel gezwungen, die Bedingungen ausländischer Investoren zu akzeptieren, unabhängig von den Folgen für Gesellschaft und Raum. Ein Beispiel für solche politischen Ad-hoc-Entscheidungen ist das auf einer Fläche von 90 Hektar entstehende Projekt Belgrade Waterfront, einschließlich des kürzlich geschlossenen zentralen Bahnhofs und seines Rangierbahnhofs. Da Raumplaner und andere einschlägige Experten als nicht in der Lage angesehen werden, sich dem politischen System zu widersetzen, und da die einzig relevante Kritik zum Projekt von Bürgerorganisationen kam, stellt der Beitrag die Rolle des Zivilsektors heraus und betrachtet ihn als ein Instrument zur Transformation des Raumplanungsansatzes einer Übergangsgesellschaft. Die kritische Analyse sowohl des regulatorischen als auch des institutionellen Rahmens der Raumordnung in Serbien deutet auf ein Paradoxon hin: Einerseits gibt es formelle Dokumente, die die Notwendigkeit und die Rolle des zivilen Sektors hervorheben, die aber nicht in der Raumordnungspraxis umgesetzt werden. Andererseits wurden die Verfahren der aktiven Beteiligung bereits vom zivilen Sektor entwickelt, jedoch fehlt der für die Etablierung dieser informellen Instrumente notwendige institutionelle Rahmen. Sich dieses Problems zu widmen, ist ein kleiner Schritt zur Förderung der serbischen Raumordnung, die sich noch im Übergang befindet.", "keywords": ["Belgrade Waterfront", "civil sector", "Raumordnungspolitik", "Serbia", "Serbien"]}

We estimate the causal effect of longer waiting times on the use of five financial coping strategies. We find that SNAP benefits are the most responsive to longer waiting times. Moreover, while spousal employment is not responsive to longer wait times, spousal employment leads to longer waiting times, presumably because these applicants are more able to appeal. Together, these results suggest that coping strategies are used to both help applicants during the wait time and to extend the waiting time and increase their probability of success.", "keywords": ["Disability", "Waiting time"]}

The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between government revenue and government expenditure in Iran by applying the bounds testing approach to cointegration. The results of the causality test show that there is a bidirectional causal relationship between government expenditure and revenues in both long run and short run. Therefore, the results of this paper are consistent with fiscal synchronization hypothesis. The policy implication of results suggests that because of existing interdependence relation between government expenditure and revenue, the government makes its expenditures and revenues decision simultaneously.

We explore country-level innovation using OECD data for research and development (R&D), patents, and exports. We deploy a dual methodology of descriptive visualization and panel regression analysis. Our results highlight industry variances in R&D spending. As a nation develops, governmental expenditure on R&D decreases, and businesses take on an increasing role to fill the gap, increasing local innovation. Our portfolio of local versus foreign resident ownership of patents highlights implications for taxation/innovation policies. Countries with high foreign ownership of patents have low tax revenues due to the lack of associated costs with, and mobility of income from, patents. We call on these countries to devise targeted policies encouraging local patent ownership. Policy makers should also recognize factors influencing high-technology exports for innovation. Lastly, we call on countries to reinstate horizontal and vertical policies, and design national innovation ecosystems that integrate disparate policies in an effort to drive economic growth through innovation.", "keywords": ["Exports", "Innovation", "Patents", "Research and development", "Science and technology"]}

Depending on its definition, the properties of short-run fluctuations, medium-run swings, and long-run stochastic trends of the labor share may vary substantially. Based on a range of historical US time series, we carry out a systematic exploration of discrepancies between the alternative labor share definitions in terms of the observed stochastic trends, shares of short-, medium- and long-run variation in total volatility of the series, degree of persistence, mean-reversion properties, and susceptibility to structural breaks. We conclude that while short-run properties of the labor shares (represented by cyclical variation below 8 years) are relatively consistent across all definitions, their medium-run swings (8-50 years) and long-run trends ( 50 years) diverge substantially. As important applications, we document the implications of our findings for growth accounting, the identification of short-run responses of the labor share to technology shocks and for estimating inflation.", "keywords": ["labor share", "persistence", "structural breaks"]}

The first part of this article provides the economic foundations for how we should expect retailers to optimally adjust their store brand prices when facing higher wholesale prices on national brands. While retailers should pass on at least some of the overcharge for national brands, resulting in a price increase for national brands, theoretically their optimal response with respect to store brands is ambiguous, as there are two potentially opposing effect, a \"demand diversion effect\" and a \"margin effect\". Consumers could thus face either lower or higher store brand prices when there is a cartel of brand manufacturers. In any case, however, the optimal reaction of retailers allows them to mitigate the immediate damage inflicted by the overcharge on national brands, which raises the question to what extent such mitigation should be accounted for in follow-on cases. In the second part of the paper we illustrate our arguments with an empirical analysis of the German coffee cartel.", "keywords": ["damage mitigation", "store brands"]}

The study employs a quantitative research method, utilizing the Generalized method of moments (GMM) on a dataset of 65 countries from the period 1994 to 2020. The research finds that environmental tax has a significant negative effect on carbon emission, and that firms with a higher level of female economic inclusion tend to have lower carbon emission levels. Furthermore, the research shows that firms with a higher level of female economic inclusion are more likely to implement environmentally sustainable practices, which in turn reduces their carbon emission levels. These findings suggest that policies that promote environmental taxation and female economic inclusion can be effective in reducing carbon emissions and promoting sustainable business practices. The sampling technique used in this study is purposive sampling, where 64 countries were selected based on their availability of data on environmental tax, carbon emissions, and female economic inclusion. The population of the study comprises all countries that have data available on these variables between the period of 1994 to 2020. While there are limitations to this study, including the need for further research to fully understand the complex relationship between environmental taxation, carbon emissions, and female economic inclusion, this research represents an important contribution to the literature on these critical issues.", "keywords": ["carbon emission", "Environmental tax", "generalized method of moments"]}

Taking into account medium-run cost and distribution effects of interest rate variations renders monetary policies completely inappropriate as an economic stabiliser. Based on these results we argue that the NCM macroeconomic policy assignment should be replaced by a PK assignment. Enhancing employment without increasing inflation will be possible if macroeconomic policies are coordinated along the following lines: The central bank targets distribution between rentiers, on the hand, and firms and employees, on the other hand, and sets low real interest rates, wage bargaining parties target inflation and fiscal policies are applied for short- and medium-run real stabilisation purposes.", "keywords": ["inflation targeting", "Macroeconomic policies", "New Consensus Model"]}

Guided by a pre-analysis plan, we document that COVID-19 increased the unemployment rate, decreased hours of work and labor force participation, especially for younger workers, non-white, not married and less-educated workers. We built four indexes (exposure to disease, proximity to coworkers, work remotely and critical workers) to study the impact of COVID-19. We find that workers that can work remotely are significantly less likely to have their labor market outcomes affected, while workers working in proximity to coworkers are more affected. The unemployment effects are significantly larger for states that implemented stay-at-home orders. Our estimates suggest that, as of early May, these policies increased unemployment by nearly 4 percentage points, but reduced COVID-19 cases by 186,600-311,000, and deaths by 17,851-23,325.

However, it is not clear how these two are related. Part of the confusion can be traced back to the measurement of entrepreneurship, biased towards independent entrepreneurship (self-employed and new firms), and excluding entrepreneurship within established organizations. We shed new light on the relationship between trust and entrepreneurship, by proposing two mechanisms relating trust to entrepreneurship by employees, so-called intrapreneurship. We hypothesize that generalized trust influences the prevalence of intrapreneurship in an economy, and the allocation of entrepreneurial talents between independent entrepreneurship and intrapreneurship, through two mechanisms. First, generalized trust may substitute for complete contracts as a means of organizing labor in society, enabling a level of job autonomy in organizations necessary for intrapreneurship to flourish. Second, by way of its influence on the size and scope of the welfare state, generalized trust may increase the benefits of employment relative to self-employment, causing entrepreneurial individuals to elect to be intrapreneurs rather than independent entrepreneurs.
